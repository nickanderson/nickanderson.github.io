<p>OK, ok, it's <strong>not really</strong> <em>bionic</em>, ... yet.</p>

<p>On [2018-05-29] I had surgery for spinal decompression and <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/intradural-disc-herniation?lang=us" title="Intradural disk
herniation">Intradural disk
herniation</a> repair at L4-L5, anterior fusion at L4-L5, and artificial disc
replacement at L5-S1. This documents some history and how I got to that point as
well as my recovery.</p>

<p>I am frequently asked "what happened?", and I don't recall any specific event,
but I wrestled in grade school and high school, and I was know for all kinds of
contortions. The dehydration and twisting and bending in bad ways may have
contributed to or aggravated my condition. As an adult I travel a fair amount
and I have experienced a strong correlation between increased back pain and air
travel. Perhaps the rapid pressure changes are detrimental to already weakened
discs.</p>

<h1 id="history-and-background">History and background</h1>

<p>I have had low back pain on and off since the early to mid 90s. In 2010 the
symptoms and pain became un-manageable. I was experiencing debilitating muscle
spasms, pressure in my right leg that felt like it would blow up and pop like a
balloon.</p>

<p>In 2010 I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/degenerative-disc-disease/what-degenerative-disc-disease" title="degenerative disc disease">degenerative disc disease</a>. I consulted with several
local surgeons and was told that my only option was a 2 level fusion. This would
have left me with a significantly degraded bending range of motion and increase
stress on the adjacent discs increasing the likely hood of failure.</p>

<p>I figured that there must be some better alternative and began my search. I came
across <a href="https://www.adrsupport.org/" title="ADR Support">ADR Support</a> and their forums filled with stories about disc replacements,
including multi-level. After much research I settled on Dr. Rick Delamarter
because I could find his published research, he seemed to have a high success
rate, and he was performing multi-level disc replacements. After consulting with
him we decided to take a much less invasive route and do just a decompression
that he hoped would get me by for about 10 years.</p>

<p>On [2010-10-09] at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles California, I had
a micro-discectomy at L4-L5.</p>

<p>Surgery was supposed to be 2 hours, it was 5. When he came out he told my wife
that it looked like I had jumped off the empire state building and landed on my
feet. He said there was tons of disc material to clean out, he was unsure how I
was able to walk at all.</p>

<p>After surgery all of my leg pain was gone. Recovery was rough. It was difficult
to get my pain under control post surgery. I continued to see improvements for
about a year after surgery.</p>

<p>Things were pretty good for about 4 years. At the end of 2014 my symptoms
started to come back. I received an epidural for pain management in January 2015
which helped to keep the symptoms under control through most of 2016. My
symptoms returned in late 2016 and the downward spiral began. I had epidurals in
April and August of 2017 with an MRI in August.</p>

<p>The MRI showed since 2014 that there was now SEVERE canal stenosis at the L4-L5
interspace with nerve root entrapment.</p>

<p>I called to schedule an appointment with the surgeon from my first surgery only
to find out he had retired from active practice. I needed to find a new surgeon,
but I was dragging my feet in the process.</p>

<p>In April of 2018 things came to a head. On a trip to Germany I ended up in the
ER for pain management. Steroids helped me to complete my trip, but once I
arrived home I was nearly bed ridden, only able to stand and walk for a few
minutes at a time before it was too much to take and I was driven to the ground.</p>

<p>By this time I had already selected my next surgeon, Dr. Hyun W. Bae who
practiced with my original surgeon Dr. Delamarter. I scheduled surgery for June
18th 2018 and got a new MRI.</p>

<h1 id="second-surgery-decompression-l4-l5-fusion-l4-l5-artificial-disc-l5-s1">Second Surgery (decompression L4-L5, fusion L4-L5, artificial disc L5-S1)</h1>

<p><img src="/images/2018-05-lumbar-mri.jpg" alt="/images/2018-05-lumbar-mri.jpg" title="/images/2018-05-lumbar-mri.jpg" /></p>

<p>On May 25th I got a call from Dr. Bae to discuss the new imaging. He was very
concerned, and did not think that I should wait a month for decompression. The
new images were much worse. He thought it would be best to have decompression
surgery immediately, and we could follow up with more permanent fixes later.
Since I didn't trust any local surgerons, we (my wife) packed up and we started
the long journey to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Things got really scary after we crossed the Rocky Mountains into western
Colorado. I found I was unable to void my bladder at a rest stop. I called Dr.
Bae and he said it was emergent. We drove non-stop from Grand Junction Colorado
directly to the Emergency Room at Providence St. Johns in Santa Monica
California where Dr. Bae and his team were waiting for me to arrive.</p>

<p>I was catheterized immediately and after getting settled I was told that they
were unsure if the issue in my back was a herniated disc or not. It was
atypical. They wanted to do a full body MRI to see if there were any evidence
that it was a tumor that had dropped down from my brain.</p>

<p>The updated full body MRI showed no new leads. So the plan was to do the
decompression surgery, test the findings to see if they were cancerous and then
evaluate for disc replacement and fusion.</p>

<p>I had surgery on [2018-05-29]. They did the decompression and found a rare case
where the herniated disc material had torn into my dural sac. They cleaned out
all the material and patched my dura. After pathology confirmed it was not
cancerous they proceeded to do a fusion at L4-L5 and a synthetic disc at L5-S1

<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>

<h3 id="2018-06-06-wed-first-day-after-being-released-from-the-hospital">[2018-06-06 Wed] First day after being released from the hospital</h3>

<p>Released from hospital yesterday. Walking with walker is OK. I am much more
stable waking with AFO, but I don't want to do anything to weaken my foot. Dr.
Bae indicates the neurological damage in the right foot may be permanent.</p>

<p>In an attempt to improve the chances that my nerves will repair themselves so
that I can regain the full use of my right foot I started myself on a coctail of
various supplements that are supposed to assist in the generation of Meylen.</p>

<p>Meylen is a mixture of proteins and phospholipids forming a whitish insulating
sheath around many nerve fibers, increasing the speed at which impulses are
conducted.</p>

<ul>
<li>Human Growth Hormone</li>
<li>Lectin</li>
<li>Ginko Biblioba</li>
<li>Vitamin B complex</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2018-06-07-thu">[2018-06-07 Thu]</h3>

<p>My right foot is like a piece of jelly. It's so weak it just flops around.</p>

<p>I walked up and down the hallway. Back achy and sore late in the afternoon and
evening.</p>

<h3 id="2018-06-08-fri">[2018-06-08 Fri]</h3>

<p>I walked down to the pool and in front of the building this afternoon. My right
foot is very numb and I can't raise my big toe at all. Well, actually, I can't
raise any of them.</p>

<p>But the rest of my bits seem to be working pretty well.</p>

<p>My front incision is uncomfortable (nothing compared to the pain before surgery)
and my belly and feet are still very swollen.</p>

<p>It was two weeks ago today that it was determined emergent and we decided we
were going to make a mad dash to LA for surgery.</p>

<h3 id="2018-06-09-sat">[2018-06-09 Sat]</h3>

<h3 id="2018-07-19-thu">[2018-07-19 Thu]</h3>

<p>I am feeling pretty good. Ready for physical therapy to start, but I must wait a
few more weeks.</p>

<p>I stopped wearing my brace while at home today. I will probably wear it when I
leave the house until I my core has strengthened and I feel more stable.</p>

<p>I am still unable to raise my right foot, and a large portion of it is still
very numb on the top.</p>

<p>I am able to walk, but I wear an AFO when I am outside of the house.</p>

<p>I am able to drive while wearing the AFO.</p>

<p>I am down to taking Tizanadine as needed (usually 4mg in the am, maybe 4mg
mid-day, and 8mg before bed). I am still taking Gabbapentin 300mg 3x day.</p>

  How did you choose a surgeon?

<ul>
<li>I search for doctors that are writing case studies and participating in</li>
  clinical trials. I look to see who is pushing the boundaries and publishing
  their findings.
