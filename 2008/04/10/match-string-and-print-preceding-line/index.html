                <p>Text processing is fun. Well, fun if you like to beat your head against a wall. Most of the time I just string a few things together to get whatever I am doing done. Its much better to find the shortest way to do something, it spawns less processes, is more efficient and generally a good idea. So if you have ever wanted to match a string from some given output and only print the preceding line here you go.</p>

<!--adsense-->

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">awk '/pattern/{print x};{x=$0}'
</pre>

<p>You might also wonder why you might want to do that. Well the reason I wanted to do it was to pull the sar output of the last run. Sar output ends in ^Average: but I just wanted the line before that so this is what I came up with.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">sar | awk '/^Average:/{print x};{x=$0}'
</pre>

<p>That just spits out the last recorded sar information like this.</p>
