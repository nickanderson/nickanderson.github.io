      <description>I want to take a minute to thank Thomas Leyer for all of his hard work and dedicated service to the LOPSA Mentorship Program Team. Thomas has been a volunteer since the programs inception, and has chaired the program for the past three years! Thanks Thomas!
I think the mentorship program is one of the best things that LOPSA offers. You should consider participating. It&amp;#8217;s a great experience whether you choose to participate in the core team, as a mentor or as a protégé, I guarantee you will learn something, and you will be affecting the future of the profession.</description>

      <description>That&amp;#8217;s right the Mentorship Program is turning 1. Like any youngster we&amp;#8217;re still learning our place in the world. We have had growing pains but we still have a bright future. In the past year we have had three program chairs Jesse Trucks, Ian Parades, and Thomas Leyer (current chair). The core team consists of Lois Bennett, Thomas Leyer and me. I&amp;#8217;d like to share some statistics with you.

      <description>When you get started as a SysAdmin you typically fall into one of 10 categories. You either had a mentor to show you the ropes, or you dredged through it on your on. It seems more and more the group that had or has a mentor is shrinking. I never had a mentor for the things I was most interested in, but my first boss did give good advice, and his words seem to ring in my head often.</description>
