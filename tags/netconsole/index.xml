      <description>Have you ever had a machine that was a bit flaky? You know those ones that occasionally crash and don&amp;#8217;t write anything useful into the log file. Sometimes you can capture those messages with netconsole. Just revisiting a small walk-through I wrote a while back.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever experienced hard lockups and seen no trace of the cause in your log files? Those situations can be even more of a pain if you do not have physical access to the machine since you will not be able to look for kernel oops on the console. You could buy a serial console or an ip kvm but if you don&amp;#8217;t have the need for remote control, but would really like to be able to debug without being physically present you need to check out netconsole. Netconsole sends printk messages over UDP. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
