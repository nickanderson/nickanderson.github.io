      <description>When I first tried using Emacs it was to play with Orgmode. I loved Orgmode but being a staunch vim user I really struggled with the key bindings. Ultimately my first attempt to use Orgmode fell by the wayside.
When I learned about evil mode I gave it another go. I stumbled my way through just enough to get evil-mode working and Orgmode became much more usable. I still primarily interacted with Orgmode via direct files.</description>

      <description>This weekend Neil Watson asked if I could share how I use org-mode with Spacemacs.
  @cmdln_ Care to share with an Emacs illiterate how you got Spacemacs and  Org-mode to work together? -- @neil_h_watson  First of all, I spend most of my time in a terminal, and vim is ingrained in my muscle memory any time I need to edit a file. While Vim is my goto editor I consider myself just a novice Vim user.</description>
