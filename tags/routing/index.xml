      <description>I re-factored rh_add_interface_routes into a new bundle rh_update_routes, you can find them in my CFEngine library.
The biggest improvement is you no longer have to specify the interface you want the route on. Instead you specify a regular expression of the ip that would be on that interface and the specific interface is found.
Second major improvement is the direct use of ip route del/add to update currently running system instead of restarting all networking.</description>
