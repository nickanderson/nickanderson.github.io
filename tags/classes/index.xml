      <description>CFEngine defines a classes for decision making during runs. Many of these hard classes you can see by running cf-promises -v. That wont show you all the other classes that are raised during a policy run.
You could run something like this to see what classes are raised during execution.
cf-agent -KIv | grep &#34;cf3&amp;gt;\s*+&#34; | grep -v : But that isn&amp;#8217;t really a clear picture under normal operation. You can use the allclassesreport in body agent control to write out a list of classes defined during execution in /var/cfengine/state/allclasses.</description>
