      <description>Many of you know that I had a son about 6 months ago now. What you may not know is that my wife decided to quit her job and start a home daycare so she could be at home with our son.

I am not a fan of the encryption or the new copy protections that have been put in place (ARccOS, RipGuard).</description>
