      <description>From time to time this is appropriate to repost. For me its that time again.
When I was hired to run the IT department of a major company my predecessor left three letters in the desk that was now mine. Each letter was clearly labeled; System Failure #1, System Failure #2, System Failure #3. A post-it note was attached to the bundle of letters.
 In case of a substantial system failure open the letters in order, once per failure, and they will help you through the problem.</description>
