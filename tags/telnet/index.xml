      <description>Don&amp;#8217;t even start with me about how telnet is horrid. Out side of my control but I recently had issues trying to enable telnet on a server. Typically its pretty straightforward.
 yum install telnet-server chkconfig telnet on chkconfig xinetd on service xinetd start  Unfortunately for me this was not working. Every time I tried to telnet to the host after enabling it I would get an error message.</description>
