      <description>IMHO one of the great benefits of virtualization is the ability to properly size your guests. Many times 512M memory and an 8G / is plenty. Increasing memory for a virtual machine is typically pretty straight forward, but there are several options when adding disk space. Mounting the space in the file system and doing something with LVM are likely the most common paths.
Depending on the situation I typically lean toward keeping my small 8G root and mounting extra storage where needed in the file system.</description>
