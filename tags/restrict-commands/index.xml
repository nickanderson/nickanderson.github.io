      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSH is a powerful tool. When combined with ssh keys, it becomes easy to automate remote procedures like backups. However leaving key access wide open can be a bad idea. It is possible to use restrict ssh keys to specific commands, even coming from specific hosts. There is this nice little perl script called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Authprogs&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; that makes this somewhat easier. Ill show you how to use authprogs for an automated rsync over ssh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
