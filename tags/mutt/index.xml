      <description>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for connecting to (im guessing here) an Exchange server at my new job I am switching from my beloved Mutt to Evolution. The absolute first thing I noticed about Evolution that I disliked was the keybindings for things like deleting messages, replying to messages and creating a new message. After some digging in the UI I could not find any place to change them. Some more sleuthing turned up some XML files down in /usr/share/evolution/$VERSION/ui.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you by now well know I try to mostly live at the console (well multiple x consoles). Mutt is my mail client of choice. I&amp;#8217;ve tried Thunderbird, Kmail, Evolution, Sylpheed, and pine. For whatever reason I feel most comfortable with mutt. I also use IMAP for both my personal and work accounts. Mutt was originally designed to deal with local mail and while it does a very good job with IMAP I don&amp;#8217;t like how it handles multiple accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
