      <description>Org-mode is my exocortex, second brain, second mind, mind palace, pensive, and personal knowledge management system. It&amp;rsquo;s very flexible and the features I use as well as how I organize my files continues to change so I collected things here to document how I do things in 2024, I did this in 2023 as well1.
No, my Emacs org-mode configuration is not published. However, if you have some question, just reach out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty much living in org-mode for 6 or 7 years now1. It&amp;rsquo;s my exocortex, second brain, second mind, mind palace, pensive, and personal knowledge management system2. The features and tools I use as well as how I organize my files has changed quite a bit over this period of time and I thought it would be nice give myself (and anyone else who cares) a reference of what it was like in 2023 so here it is.</description>
