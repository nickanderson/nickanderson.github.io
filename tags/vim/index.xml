      <title>Flashback: Vim customization for python</title>

      <description>Python has become my language of choice for automation and general scripting. Its nice to have an editor that makes things easier when your doing things. Its also nice to use an editor that you can find just about anywhere. I have customized my vim to make doing things in python much quicker and this is an old post where I talk about some of the modifications.

      <description>I use vim for the vast majority of my editing. It can be a bit cumbersom to hit esc each time you want to perform a command while in insert mode. Using ctrl o will put you in command mode for the next command. Give it a try sometime it may or may not make you more effective with vim.</description>

      <title>Vim &#43; wordpress == vimpress, happiness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently found a vim plug-in for WordPress. &lt;a href=&#34;http://friggeri.net/blog/2007/07/13/vimpress&#34;&gt;Vimpress&lt;/a&gt; allows your to write and edit your blog posts directly from vim. Sure it has its limitations. There does not appear to be support for future data publishing or drafts. But overall its a much better experience to write in vim than the built in editor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tip: Vim point in time recovery</title>

      <description>Hopefully you know how to undo and redo in vim using u and Ctrl-R. But with newer versions of vim you get point in time recovery. with :earlier. Give it a shot, make some changes to a script and then try :earlier 1m. Very cool and an easy way to undo a bunch of changes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python seems to keep growing on me. By no means am I a Python master, nor am I a vim guru but I do prefer to use vim over a gui editor. Sure there are some niceties with using a gui but getting comfortable using a tool that is almost always at your disposal has something to be said for it. Adding a few things to your vim environment will make writing python much more pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
