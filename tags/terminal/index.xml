      <description>Last week I stumbled on a nice console regex helper. It&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;m bad at regex but switching between sed, vim, python, perl regex trips me up a bit sometimes.
Go ahead and check it out for yourself
sudo aptitude install txt2regex  &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; [.]quit [0]reset [*]color [/]programs ^txt2regex$
!! not supported
RegEx perl :
RegEx php :
RegEx postgres:
RegEx python :
RegEx sed :
RegEx vim :</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have said before life at the terminal is a joy. I constantly struggle with keeping myself organized. I actually work pretty well keeping most things in my head. But one of these days I&amp;#8217;m going to fall down and hit my head and forget everything. So try and try again to keep myself organized and documented do I. I was recently pointed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/schacon/ticgit/tree/master&#34;&gt;TicGit&lt;/a&gt; its a ticketing system that is meant to integrate right into your repository. Well I&amp;#8217;m not a developer but I can see the benefit for a terminal todo list and general ticketing for myself as well as my little script repository that is actually maintained in git. Well ok maybe maintained is a bit strong of a word. Anyway on to the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmdln.org/2007/07/20/automatic-session-logging-and-monitoring-with-gnu-screen-for-the-paranoid/&#34; mce_href=&#34;http://www.cmdln.org/2007/07/20/automatic-session-logging-and-monitoring-with-gnu-screen-for-the-paranoid/&#34;&gt; Automatic session logging and monitoring with GNU screen&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been well received. I have had more hits by far on that post today than ever before. I noticed a nagging issue with screen and a friend of mine Travis Cline pointed me to the fix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
