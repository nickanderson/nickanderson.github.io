      <description>I’ve been working with puppet a lot in the last few weeks. I really enjoy this style of administration compared to “ssh in a for loop”. Its great to script things and I still do it but for maintaining configuration I don’t know if it gets much better than puppet. That being said I ran into a few issues today that had me splitting my head open on my desk, keyboard, pop cans and just about everything else I could reach.</description>

      <description>Matt Simmons recently had another post that mentioned structured systems management. I find myself re-reading Ad-Hoc vs Structured Systems Management from time to time and I figure its time for me to chime in.
First off, Michael Jankes’ post is one of my favorite blog post reads. Few posts do I ever re-read unless its tutorialesque. For a quick sidetrack one of those posts that I do return to when I deal with developers is The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code.</description>
