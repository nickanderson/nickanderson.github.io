      <description>I updated the CFEngine 3 by example vagrant project so that /var/cfengine/masterfiles is a git clone (kept in sync with VCS::vcs_mirror) of the generated bare repository from the seed files. I found during a presentation that it would just be easier to have everyone start of with the typical workflow instead of going through the process of getting there. I hope it makes it easier for people to get a working test env up in a few minutes.</description>
