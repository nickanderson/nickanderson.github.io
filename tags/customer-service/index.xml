      <description>I just wanted to share my NetApp customer service experience since usually people only share negative experiences. I needed to download a mib for a NetApp today. I really don&amp;#8217;t like that I have to register an account just to download a mib but whatever. I was really upset after registering the account and entering a system-id to find that I didn&amp;#8217;t have access to download any mibs.
I saw that feedback button glaring at me so decided to give it a shot, left a &amp;#8220;very dissatisfied&amp;#8221; about download experience review.</description>
