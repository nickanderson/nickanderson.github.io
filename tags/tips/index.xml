      <description>There is a known bug where getindices is unable to get the index of a dynamically generated array until the next pass. This comes up from time to time so I thought I would post an example using a pattern shared on the CFEngine help mailing list. The policy below shows 3 working examples. They are mostly similar, example0 shows the simplest workaround, example1 and example2 in addition show ways to suppress the &amp;#8220;Duplicate selection of value for variable&amp;#8221; messages.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is more or less going to be an addendum to my last post as well as an update to my previous screenrc post. About 5 minutes after posting I realized that my additions to my prompt broke some new additions to new screenrc settings.&lt;/p&gt;
