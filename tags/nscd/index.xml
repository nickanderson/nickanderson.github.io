      <description>Had a slightly vexing issue the other day. During a migration the destination host ended up caching some stale DNS entries. I tried a quick restart of nscd to no avail, rebooted the VM, again no joy. Even overriding the host in /etc/hosts wasn&amp;#8217;t working. Took a few minutes of digging but what did work was
nscd -i hosts . Just something to remember if you ever seem to have a stubborn caching issue, rebooting/restarting wont always solve the issue.</description>
