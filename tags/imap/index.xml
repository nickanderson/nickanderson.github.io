      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you by now well know I try to mostly live at the console (well multiple x consoles). Mutt is my mail client of choice. I&amp;#8217;ve tried Thunderbird, Kmail, Evolution, Sylpheed, and pine. For whatever reason I feel most comfortable with mutt. I also use IMAP for both my personal and work accounts. Mutt was originally designed to deal with local mail and while it does a very good job with IMAP I don&amp;#8217;t like how it handles multiple accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
