      <description>Yesterday I had a tip on removing yourself from any testing for that google sidebar that your likely seeing in your search results now. I woke up to a nasty surprise. After removing the cookie yesterday, today I had the bar again. So I removed the cookie again, and it came right back. Thats when a friend pointed out that google was rolling it out to everyone. OH NO!
Well, luckily you can get a browser extension for Firefox or Chrome that makes it disappear from the guys over at seotools.</description>

      <description>Google is constantly doing experiments to see what its users like best. Today I was slapped with one of their tests, the &amp;#8220;Everything Sidebar&amp;#8221;. It really screwed with me and was entirely distracting while I was searching. So naturally I looked for a way to reverse it. It&amp;#8217;s easy enough, you just need to delete a cookie.
Here is a screen shot of the results page

At any rate, if you want it gone just delete the PREF cookie from google.</description>
