      <description>I am happy to see how many sites are participating in the SOPA/PIPA protest today. I am a bit disapointed that facebook did not join (at least yet), and google only doing a doodle seems a little bit on the weak side. Still its nice when so many people can show support for something so threatening. There is quite a list of sites that are blacked out in one way or another today.</description>
