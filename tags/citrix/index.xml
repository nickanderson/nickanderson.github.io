      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are aware of my affinity for the Xen hypervisor. In the last year I have switched over to Citrix Xenserver. With other people managing VMs as well having a nice GUI is helpful. One of my complaints is that the GUI (XenCenter) is a windows only app. C’mon, Citrix, please release a cross platform management console. I’ve got to run a windows VM just to use the GUI (granted I don’t have to use the gui, there is a nice API and console utilities). At any rate today I noticed that I could no longer pull up the console for a windows VM nor could I pull up the performance metrics available in XenCenter. A few searches turned up &lt;a href=&#34;http://kennethhunt.com&#34;&gt;Kenneth Hunts blog&lt;/a&gt; and a post that showed me where to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Citrix makes Xen Enterprise Free</title>

      <description>Today Citrix announced that it will distribute its enterprise packaging of Xen for free. This brings fancy gui management and features available in VMwares ESX server to everyone. (Actually I’m not clear if just the ability is there or if they actually are letting the gui go as well.)
This is not a scaled down, limited version of the hypervisor. From the end of March on, there will be only one edition of XenServer which and it will be free.</description>
