      <title>Growing a root file system</title>
      <link>http://www.cmdln.org/2010/07/13/growing-a-root-file-system/</link>

      <description>IMHO one of the great benefits of virtualization is the ability to properly size your guests. Many times 512M memory and an 8G / is plenty. Increasing memory for a virtual machine is typically pretty straight forward, but there are several options when adding disk space. Mounting the space in the file system and doing something with LVM are likely the most common paths.
Depending on the situation I typically lean toward keeping my small 8G root and mounting extra storage where needed in the file system.</description>

      <title>Fix XenCenter not displaying console or performance statistics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are aware of my affinity for the Xen hypervisor. In the last year I have switched over to Citrix Xenserver. With other people managing VMs as well having a nice GUI is helpful. One of my complaints is that the GUI (XenCenter) is a windows only app. C&amp;#8217;mon, Citrix, please release a cross platform management console. I&amp;#8217;ve got to run a windows VM just to use the GUI (granted I don&amp;#8217;t have to use the gui, there is a nice API and console utilities). At any rate today I noticed that I could no longer pull up the console for a windows VM nor could I pull up the performance metrics available in XenCenter. A few searches turned up &lt;a href=&#34;http://kennethhunt.com&#34;&gt;Kenneth Hunts blog&lt;/a&gt; and a post that showed me where to fix it. The windows box running XenCenter has a cache folder located in %AppData%\Citrix\XenCenterMain.exe_Url_xxxxxxxxxx. If you remove the cache you should be able to see the console and performance graphs again. If by chance you remove the entire folder you will need to re-add all dom0s back into XenCenter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am so very tired of hearing about &amp;#8220;the cloud&amp;#8221;. Over lunch the other day a co-worker decided we should just call it the phog instead since the phog does a better job of describing exactly what is meant by the cloud.
Why is phog a better description? The phog has no defined shape, you can&amp;#8217;t see clearly in it, its different everywhere you go, and once your in the middle of it you can&amp;#8217;t find your way out (due to marketing fluf).</description>

      <title>Citrix makes Xen Enterprise Free</title>

      <description>Today Citrix announced that it will distribute its enterprise packaging of Xen for free. This brings fancy gui management and features available in VMwares ESX server to everyone. (Actually I&amp;#8217;m not clear if just the ability is there or if they actually are letting the gui go as well.)
This is not a scaled down, limited version of the hypervisor. From the end of March on, there will be only one edition of XenServer which and it will be free.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After more testing I have narrowed the issue that I left off with to a problem with the yum conf inside of the chroot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At work I am just beginning the process of migrating from a hosted dedicated server to a Xen instance on a new server we have. Our dedicated server runs centos, and has WHM cpanel installed. So I figured it would be a good thing to have cpanel again as several people are familiar with it, and we do host a few random websites for people still. Cpanel does not support debian to my knowledge so Centos 5 sounds like the best way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am in the process of setting up Xen on one of my new servers. Just sticking some notes here. Will clean them up later
