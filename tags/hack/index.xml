      <description>Yesterday I had a tip on removing yourself from any testing for that google sidebar that your likely seeing in your search results now. I woke up to a nasty surprise. After removing the cookie yesterday, today I had the bar again. So I removed the cookie again, and it came right back. Thats when a friend pointed out that google was rolling it out to everyone. OH NO!&#xA;Well, luckily you can get a browser extension for Firefox or Chrome that makes it disappear from the guys over at seotools.</description>
