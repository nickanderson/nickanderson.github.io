      <description>&lt;p&gt;Proper email form (specifically top vs bottom posting) is something that has been on my mind lately. I am trying to share the benefits of trimming and bottom posting with my co-workers. They don&amp;#8217;t seem to be taking kindly to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say my largest pet peeve when trying to teach good email habits is the &amp;#8220;It takes to long&amp;#8221; comment. In a business setting this sends shooting pains through my bones. Essentially you are saying the customer is not deserving or worth the time to take a few extra seconds when crafting a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your interested in what my thoughts on top vs bottom posting read on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
