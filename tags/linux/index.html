In 2016 and 2017 KLF was hosted in Wichita KS at Wichita State University. The prior two years organizers are a bit burned out and are taking a break.
   Hi nickanderson, Sadly at the moment there is not a KLF 2018  planned. The few of us who created KLF 2017 are rather burned out  and need a break this year :-(   However, if we can find some new people who are willing to take it  on either in Wichita or somewhere else in Kansas, then we would be  more than happy to assist in the infrastructure side and to  consult as part of the conference .</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I have been using bibble for about a year now. Its the best photo editing software that ran on linux that I could find. It probably isn&#8217;t as polished as Photoshop but it has its own great features like threading so it can use all of your cores for rendering.
Just over a week ago I noticed it had been bought by Corel and its been re-branded to AfterShotPro. I really hope they continue to develop it and provide Linux support.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I&#8217;m curious what anyone who reads this blog thinks. My first reaction when someone mentions Ubuntu server is to grab the nearest trout and start slapping. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I like Ubuntu. It&#8217;s very nice on a workstation, and suitable for my wife, mother, aunt, etc &#8230;. But do you really think its good enough for prime time in the data center? According to a server-survey conducted by the Ubuntu marketing team almost 80% of users see Ubuntu as ready for mission critical use.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Monitoring and analyzing performance is an important task for any sysadmin. Disk I/O bottlenecks can bring applications to a crawl. What are IOPS?Â Should I use SATA, SAS, or FC? How many spindles do I need? What RAID level should I use? Is my system read or write heavy? These are common questions for anyone embarking on an disk I/O analysis quest. Obligatory disclaimer: I do not consider myself an expert in storage or anything for that mater.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Recently a developer came to me and said they are starting to see failed builds apparently due to open file handle limitations on the build server. In case your not aware, by default there are limitations on users to ensure they don&#8217;t hog the entire resources of a system. Sometimes these limitations need to be adjusted.
In my case the &#8220;bamboo&#8221; user needed more than 1024 open files on occasion. I determined my system had a maximum number of open files of 1572928.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I&#8217;m not a fan of OSX and I try to avoid it with the same veracity that I avoid Windows.

After a bit of digging I found the solution.
I needed to instruct the client to use a privledged port by adding the &#8220;-P&#8221; option.</p></div>
