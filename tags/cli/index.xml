      <description>Besides the gui/vnc consoles you can still use the equivlent of xm console in Citrix XenServer.
On the host console:
 xe vm-list to get the list of domins running (just note the uuid of the domain you want). list_domains will list the domain name and the uuid of the domains. Match up your uuid so you get the proper dom_id xm console equivlent is /usr/lib/xen/bin/xenconsole dom_id  Its not in the root users $PATH though I think it ought to be.</description>

      <description>Another day, another flashback. I don&amp;#8217;t know about you but at times I have had some very odd and uncomfortable requests from vendors. It&amp;#8217;s not whollyÂ uncommon for them to want to log into your system to diagnose an issue for themselves. Or perhaps for whatever reason your manager says hey give this random outside person access to some important box. As a SA you get used to extremely odd requests and figure out how to just solve the problem.</description>
