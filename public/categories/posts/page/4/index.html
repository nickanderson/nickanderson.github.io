			<div class="post-summary"><p>That’s right the Mentorship Program is turning 1. Like any youngster we’re still learning our place in the world. We have had growing pains but we still have a bright future. In the past year we have had three program chairs Jesse Trucks, Ian Parades, and Thomas Leyer (current chair). The core team consists of Lois Bennett, Thomas Leyer and me. I’d like to share some statistics with you.
Projects initiated: 15</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Well I’ve been running gnome-shell for a couple days now. Overall I like it, the desktop environment stays out of my way which is a good thing. But it has been staying out of my way a little too much.
I have been missing a lot of instant messages since installing gnome-shell. The reason is because of the way the notifications work. If you actually sitting at your desk and you get a msg this tiny little bar pops up with the msg content, and its really nice you can just reply right there without ever having to open your chat client.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Well I gave unity the old college try in ubuntu 11.04. But last night I just couldn’t take it any more. There were some small rendering issues occasionally plus some tray programs like workrave had no place to go, at least that I could find anyway and I really need workrave to remind me to change from sitting to standing positions every so often.
At any rate I decided to try gnome3 and gnome-shell.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>check_snmp_extend is a python script that I found orphaned on some Nagios forum. It facilitates using snmpd as an agent for executing Nagios plugin scripts. I adopted it made a few changes and tossed it on github a while back. I’m happy to merge initial snmp v3 support from Lee Whalen</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Today I spent some time checking out google plus. If you haven’t heard about it by now you probably live under a rock. Google plus is googles latest push into the social networking scene. I’ve never been real hip on the social networking scene.
I have a twitter account @cmdln_ but I rarely actually follow the people I am following. The signal to noise ratio is just so high. And beyond that its information overload and trying to catch up on someone elses conversation seems cumbersome and annoying.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Monitoring systems utilize agents running on the monitored system in order to provide a consistent access mechanism to get at host and application data. Hypric has an agent, Zabbix has an agent, Nagios has NRPE as an agent option, collectd has an agent. Maybe its just my flawed perception but when I think of agent based monitoring SNMP isn’t one of the first things that comes to mind. Apparently I am not alone, in his blog on it.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>April 1st. I had a fairly eventful day, first I found that the phone system at $work has been mis-configured since it was installed. Second I got a call from someone I had worked with a few years back about a system that did not have backups that had a raid hiccup tanking the system a few days ago needing help with a restore.
The phone system Several months back a new phone system was installed at my office.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Yes folks, its that time of year to start thinking about the Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA), this marks the 25th Large anniversary of the event. The Theme for LISA ’11 is “DevOps: New Challenges, Proven Values.”. I have seen many different definitions for DevOps [1], in general I am not a fan of the term but the core ideas I think are common sense for anyone who has been herding cats for very long.</p></div>

Mostly I am looking forward to the sensational stories. A week or so ago I heard a guy on NPR claim that ISPs might try to make people “share” Ips and you might end up with a “party line” situation.</p></div>
