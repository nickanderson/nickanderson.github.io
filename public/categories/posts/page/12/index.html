			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>A while back I wrote about using Apache as a dynamic reverse proxy. Anyone who has done even minimal research into web servers knows that Apache is the swiss army knife. It trys to be everything for everyone, and like a swiss army knife may not be as good as a more refined too at least as far as efficiency is concerned.
Here is the situation. You have a single pinhole into your private network.</p></div>

I don’t know about anyone else but I had to turn off some of my feeds over the past several days. I was sick and tired of all the Chrome OS posts filtering about the net. It’s not that I don’t think having google behind another linux platform is a bad idea.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2009-07-07</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I recently had to write an init script for our continuous integration systems remote build agent. Of course this agent is a java jar and does not write its own pidfile. On debian or gentoo (yes I used to rice it) this would not have been an issue. Both have and use start-stop-daemon in their init scripts. start-stop-daemon actually understands that not every process you might want to daemonize writes its own pidfile and thus gives you the ability to daemonize a process, capture its pid, and write a pidfile.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2009-07-04</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Recently I have been working on cleaning up our continuous integration enviornment. Continuous integration is pretty cool but don’t shoot yourself in the foot by making bad build plans and not being very specific about your build requirements. If you have a package dependancy for a build make sure you put it in your requirements. If you need specific access to a database to do fixture tests SPECIFY it.
In the short term you can see the benefits of continuous integration without doing these things.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>I know I’ve been absent. I am not appologising I’ve been adjusting to the new job and its been keeping me busy. I did notice that my traffic tanked around the 20th of May and pretty much stayed that way until June 9th. I don’t know where everyone went but I’m glad to have you back.
I don’t really have any ideas for articles at the moment but I am working on some virtualization at work.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>If you haven’t noticed Matt Simmons moved off of blogspot today. If you have not yet go and check out his new home http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com.
In other news I’ve been slammed. Nothing exceptional to report really I’ve been spending most of my time doing machine inventory and weeding out unused servers. Yeah not glamorus but its fun in its own way. Ive pulled almost 30 machines from the server room that were unused.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p><p>In preparation for connecting to (im guessing here) an Exchange server at my new job I am switching from my beloved Mutt to Evolution. The absolute first thing I noticed about Evolution that I disliked was the keybindings for things like deleting messages, replying to messages and creating a new message. After some digging in the UI I could not find any place to change them. Some more sleuthing turned up some XML files down in /usr/share/evolution/$VERSION/ui.</p></p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>From time to time this is appropriate to repost. For me its that time again.
When I was hired to run the IT department of a major company my predecessor left three letters in the desk that was now mine. Each letter was clearly labeled; System Failure #1, System Failure #2, System Failure #3. A post-it note was attached to the bundle of letters.
 In case of a substantial system failure open the letters in order, once per failure, and they will help you through the problem.</p></div>
