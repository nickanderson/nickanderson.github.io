			<div class="post-summary"><p>I have a love/hate relationship with cpanel. On one hand it makes low end hosting a breeze, on the other its a huge pita if you want to do anything “outside the box”. Perhaps it’s not such a pain if you work with cpanel frequently. But I find cpanel beneficial because it aids in tasks that I don’t do frequently, and can offload many of those tasks to less technical people.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday I had a tip on removing yourself from any testing for that google sidebar that your likely seeing in your search results now. I woke up to a nasty surprise. After removing the cookie yesterday, today I had the bar again. So I removed the cookie again, and it came right back. Thats when a friend pointed out that google was rolling it out to everyone. OH NO!
Well, luckily you can get a browser extension for Firefox or Chrome that makes it disappear from the guys over at seotools.</p></div>

Here&rsquo;s a problem that sounded impossible&hellip; I almost regret posting the story to a wide audience, because it makes a great tale over drinks at a conference. :-) The story is slightly altered in order to protect the guilty, elide over irrelevant and boring details, and generally make the whole thing more entertaining.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Google is constantly doing experiments to see what its users like best. Today I was slapped with one of their tests, the “Everything Sidebar”. It really screwed with me and was entirely distracting while I was searching. So naturally I looked for a way to reverse it. It’s easy enough, you just need to delete a cookie.
Here is a screen shot of the results page

At any rate, if you want it gone just delete the PREF cookie from google.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2010-04-29</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I’m curious what anyone who reads this blog thinks. My first reaction when someone mentions Ubuntu server is to grab the nearest trout and start slapping. Don’t get me wrong I like Ubuntu. It’s very nice on a workstation, and suitable for my wife, mother, aunt, etc …. But do you really think its good enough for prime time in the data center? According to a server-survey conducted by the Ubuntu marketing team almost 80% of users see Ubuntu as ready for mission critical use.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2010-04-22</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Monitoring and analyzing performance is an important task for any sysadmin. Disk I/O bottlenecks can bring applications to a crawl. What are IOPS? Should I use SATA, SAS, or FC? How many spindles do I need? What RAID level should I use? Is my system read or write heavy? These are common questions for anyone embarking on an disk I/O analysis quest. Obligatory disclaimer: I do not consider myself an expert in storage or anything for that mater.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>As anyone in the search industry can tell you, getting website traffic for your primary keywords and phrases in organic search can mean the difference between the success or failure of your website. If you are a site owner, website failure can have a detrimental impact on the profitability of your company. If instead you are an SEO or web consultant, this can make or break your reputation in the industry.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2010-04-15</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I don’t think I bothered to complain here but I sure sent my fair share of nasty grams. In fact Dell became one of my four letter words after I heard they were firmware locking Gen11 servers to only dell drives. Of course it was a mistake but I loved to unashamedly repeat the famous quote from Howard Shoobe.
 “There are a number of benefits for using Dell qualified drives in particular ensuring a positive experience and protecting our data.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2010-04-12</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Recently a developer came to me and said they are starting to see failed builds apparently due to open file handle limitations on the build server. In case your not aware, by default there are limitations on users to ensure they don’t hog the entire resources of a system. Sometimes these limitations need to be adjusted.
In my case the “bamboo” user needed more than 1024 open files on occasion. I determined my system had a maximum number of open files of 1572928.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I’m not a fan of OSX and I try to avoid it with the same veracity that I avoid Windows. But I recently needed to have a Linux NFS export mounted on an OSX server. A simple mount server:/export /mymountpoint didn’t work and returned “Operation not permitted”. After a bit of digging I found the solution.
I needed to instruct the client to use a privledged port by adding the “-P” option.</p></div>
