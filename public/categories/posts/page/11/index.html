If your shell is bash, next time that happens try ctrl-x ctrl-e.

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Ryan Nedeff posted a comment over on Matt Simmons blog about the Future of System Administrators. Mainly he was responding to a comment by Michael Halligan on twitter stating “I feel that any sysadmin today who isn’t learning Ruby and either Chef or Puppet will be unemployed in 5 years”. Ryan brought up the debate of breadth of knowledge vs depth of knowledge. I think its a great discussion to have so lets have it.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>I am so very tired of hearing about “the cloud”. Over lunch the other day a co-worker decided we should just call it the phog instead since the phog does a better job of describing exactly what is meant by the cloud.
Why is phog a better description? The phog has no defined shape, you can’t see clearly in it, its different everywhere you go, and once your in the middle of it you can’t find your way out (due to marketing fluf).</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2009-08-01</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Debian is departing (if ever so slightly) from the historical mantra “It ships when its ready”.
Looks as if Debian has decided time based freeze schedules will help them better manage time. Note they are not adopting time based releases, only the freeze is time based. I personally think this is a good thing. It will still ship when its ready but at least there will be some semblance of a time line for new releases.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>I’m sure you have heard about the open letter from Centos regarding not having control of some key elements of the project and the AWOL admin. I purposely did not comment on this because I did not want to spread any FUD. Centos is a huge project, I had no doubt that things would get rectified in a timely manner.
Here is the latest
 The CentOS Development team had a routine meeting today with Lance Davis in attendance.</p></div>

Today is not the day to worry about your infrastructure falling apart today is a day for celebration.

				<h4 class="post-date">2009-07-30</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I’ve been working with puppet a lot in the last few weeks. I really enjoy this style of administration compared to “ssh in a for loop”. Its great to script things and I still do it but for maintaining configuration I don’t know if it gets much better than puppet. That being said I ran into a few issues today that had me splitting my head open on my desk, keyboard, pop cans and just about everything else I could reach.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>I have to use windows for a few things at my new employeer. I’ve found a few programs that I just cant survive using windows without.
 Launchy – Gnome-do like launcher Quotefix – Properly bottom post when replying to emails IsoRecorder – Right click iso and burn Cygwin – Linux-like environment for Windows  I still spend very little time in windows so its not too bad but when I am there not having access to those tools drives me batty.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Matt Simmons recently had another post that mentioned structured systems management. I find myself re-reading Ad-Hoc vs Structured Systems Management from time to time and I figure its time for me to chime in.
First off, Michael Jankes’ post is one of my favorite blog post reads. Few posts do I ever re-read unless its tutorialesque. For a quick sidetrack one of those posts that I do return to when I deal with developers is The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code.</p></div>
