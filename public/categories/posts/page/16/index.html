I’ve tried Thunderbird, Kmail, Evolution, Sylpheed, and pine. For whatever reason I feel most comfortable with mutt. I also use IMAP for both my personal and work accounts. Mutt was originally designed to deal with local mail and while it does a very good job with IMAP I don’t like how it handles multiple accounts.</p></p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2008-11-02</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Recently I had to move a website that gets a fair amount of traffic. I prepared for this by lowering the TTL on the domains associated several weeks in advance to 600 seconds. Originally my plan was to toss up a maintenance page on the old server, change the DNS, and figured that within a few hours max the vast majority of DNS servers would have the update being that TTL had been set at 600 seconds for several weeks and prior to that it was set at 48 hours. This was all planned for the middle of the night on a weekend (very slow traffic time). I was in for a rude awakening the next morning.</p></p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Proper email form (specifically top vs bottom posting) is something that has been on my mind lately. I am trying to share the benefits of trimming and bottom posting with my co-workers. They don’t seem to be taking kindly to it.</p>
<p>I would say my largest pet peeve when trying to teach good email habits is the “It takes to long” comment. In a business setting this sends shooting pains through my bones. Essentially you are saying the customer is not deserving or worth the time to take a few extra seconds when crafting a response.</p>
<p>If your interested in what my thoughts on top vs bottom posting read on.</p></p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p><p>I recently found a vim plug-in for WordPress. <a href="http://friggeri.net/blog/2007/07/13/vimpress">Vimpress</a> allows your to write and edit your blog posts directly from vim. Sure it has its limitations. There does not appear to be support for future data publishing or drafts. But overall its a much better experience to write in vim than the built in editor.</p></p></div>

You may as well go ahead and copy your publick key to your git server now as well.
Log into your gitosis server
 Make sure setuptools is installed  sudo aptitude install python-setuptools
git clone git://eagain.net/gitosis.git
cd gitosis</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Hopefully you know how to undo and redo in vim using u and Ctrl-R. But with newer versions of vim you get point in time recovery. with :earlier. Give it a shot, make some changes to a script and then try :earlier 1m. Very cool and an easy way to undo a bunch of changes.</p></div>
