                    <p>From time to time this is appropriate to repost. For me its that time again.</p>
<p>When I was hired to run the IT department of a major company my predecessor left three letters in the desk that was now mine. Each letter was clearly labeled; System Failure #1, System Failure #2, System Failure #3. A post-it note was attached to the bundle of letters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case of a substantial system failure open the letters in order, once per failure, and they will help you through the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put the letters back in the desk and forgot about them.</p>
<p>About one year later we had a cascading server failure that left our corporate intranet and several important production servers off-line. While repairing the problem I remembered the letters. Curious, I opened the first letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blame me, your predecessor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day after we got the servers back up I was called in to my boss;s office to explain what happened and why were down for so long. Taking my cue from the letter I blamed my predecessor. My boss was satisfied with my answer and let me go.</p>
<p>About six months down the road we had another big failure. This time our primary database server went down and the secondary was having trouble dealing with the load. I had to put a lot of extra hours into getting them back up and we lost a few transactions due to the backup server not being able to function under the load.</p>
<p>Once again, I reached into that desk drawer and opened letter #2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blame the equipment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time I lamented to the boss about how it wasnâ€™t my fault. It was that backup server! If we had some good equipment to run on these things just would not happen. He was satisfied with my answer and I went back to work.</p>
<p>Things ran smoothly for the next 18 months. Then we got hit with a virus that somehow got past our firewall and wreaked havoc on our systems.</p>
<p>I opened the third letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write three letters</p>
</blockquote>
