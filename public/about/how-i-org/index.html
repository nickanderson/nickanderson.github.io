                    <p>Org-mode is my exocortex, second brain, second mind, mind palace, pensive, personal knowledge management system, and apocrypha. It&rsquo;s very flexible and the features I use as well as how I organize my files continues to change so I collected things here to document how I do things. I try to snapshot this periodically, so you might be interested in checking out one of those:</p>
<pre><code>[How I org in 2023](https://cmdln.org/2023/03/25/how-i-org-in-2023/)

<div class="NOTE">
<p>No, my Emacs org-mode configuration is not published. However, if you have some question, just reach out.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Ideally, I want total recall (what was I doing, who did I talk to, what do I need to do, what have I done), to be able to access my information in 5, 10, 20 or 100 years from now without strife. I want to work and interact with my system efficiently and I want to expand my knowledge and be able to share with others.</p>
<p>On the best of days I never leave Emacs and I have a full record of everything I did and how much time I spent working on it.</p>
<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<p>As of Thursday, December  5, 2024
I had 71MB
of <code>.org</code> files in <code>~/org</code>. 6101
files and 1453607
lines of text, the largest single file was 1.4MB
and the longest lined file had 26370
lines.</p>
<p>6072
of these files were inside Org-roam, the majority of them (4525
) were &ldquo;dailies&rdquo;. There were 18749
nodes in total, so about 3
nodes per file. This seemed accurate since many headlines (I had 70908
headlines) didn&rsquo;t have IDs. IDs got created automatically when I stored a link (which often happened during capture) or attached a file.</p>
<h2 id="system">System <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t follow any formal system. I use my own S.H.I.T. (Stuff here&rsquo;n there) methodology.</p>

<p>The core of my system are daily notes. I have many different daily notes, but my work log is the one that I spend the most time in. It&rsquo;s where I note down each thing I work on and track how much time I spent working on each thing.</p>
<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>
<p>Capturing is central to my work flow. It&rsquo;s the first thing I do when I sit down and get started working. It&rsquo;s important that I can quickly store new information in my system at any time and I do this most frequently with <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-today</code>.</p>
<p>Org-roam&rsquo;s capture templates provide a key feature that I found lacking from <code>org-capture</code>, the ability to seed a new file from a template. Prior to using org-roam I had no good way to populate a new file with a bunch of scaffolding. Once I started using org-roam back in 2020 the volume of capture templates I use skyrocketed from less than 10 to 72 now.</p>
<p>was an important concept in my workflow. Fundamentally it&rsquo;s grabbing new content and putting it somewhere. It facilitated consistency and automated some tedium of organization. I needed capturing to be fast and not interrupt my flow.</p>
<p>Org-roam was my primary capture interface and I <em>really</em> liked the daily capabilities. Each day I captured notes about everything I was working on into my work log while clocking time. This gave me a nice place to think and process what I was working on as well as a place to get my bearings and see what I had been working on when I got side-tracked. Having a new file each day gave me a fresh start and it helped me to avoid performance issues I had previously experienced with large (multi-megabyte) files.</p>
<p>I had <code>24</code> org-capture-templates,  <code>19</code> org-roam-capture-templates and <code>95</code> org-roam-dailies-capture-templates.</p>
