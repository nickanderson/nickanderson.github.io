                <p>Being able to send email manually seems to be a bit of a lost art. It is extremely handy to know how to use telnet to send email for testing procmail filters, and any other part of your mail system. It can also be fun to spoof email to a friend or co-worker. Read on for a quick run down.</p>

<p>Open a connection to the mail server.</p>

<p>Now initiate the SMTP session. The host connecting to the remote SMTP server identifies itself by it&#8217;s fully qualified DNS host name, so be sure to replace localhost.localdomain with your sending servers FQDN.</p>
