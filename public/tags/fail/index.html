						<div class="post-summary"><p>April 1st. I had a fairly eventful day, first I found that the phone system at $work has been mis-configured since it was installed. Second I got a call from someone I had worked with a few years back about a system that did not have backups that had a raid hiccup tanking the system a few days ago needing help with a restore.
The phone system Several months back a new phone system was installed at my office.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Why do applications have such horrible error messages. Non-specific errors are really not any more helpful than not logging at all.
I was recently setting up autofs for mounting home directories from an nfs server. The little buggers refused to work right. All I was seeing in the logfile was a notice that an attempt was made, and failed.
attempting to mount entry /home/nanderso failed to mount /home/nanderso   How helpful is that?</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Ewwww, scary isn&#8217;t it. No Its not Halloween, but you may have entered the twilight zone. Right, I never touch Microsoft products. Well in actuality sometimes I do (I just don&#8217;t brag about it). Some of the development at $work uses Microsofts Mediaroom, and I have a &#8220;Personal Server&#8221; (great name right?) that the developers use. I was trying to install the Mediaroom service pack yesterday and took some notes on the process. Some of my friends found it quite entertaining. I found it quite aggravating﻿ as you might imagine.</p></p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I am a big fan of chat support. I don&#8217;t have to drain my battery waiting on hold until its my turn in the queue. Plus when dealing with error messages its infinitely more helpful to be able to copy/paste to the agent. Sadly finding competent help is still an issue. Here is an excerpt from a recent chat support experience.
