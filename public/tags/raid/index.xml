      <description>I am in the process of setting up one of my new servers. Yes my old dual pIII machines are going to retire. They are going to live in a “retirement community” :P. Any way This time around I am going to use a mirror to protect my data. I never experienced a hardware failure before but I figure better safe than sorry right? So I am going to outline the steps needed to boot from a RAID0.</description>

      <description>So what kind of performance should people expect from a disk or raid?
How long should it take to create 100G file?
time dd if=/dev/zero of=mako1 bs=65536 count=163840
A customer of ours is using this to create a 10G file and its taking about 20 minutes to create the file on a 12 drive raid 5 with 3ware. After setting ra again (in case the customer did not) and I got about 18 minutes on the same command.</description>
