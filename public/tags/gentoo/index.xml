      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know how many of you know that I am a recovering gentoo user. One of the staples of my desktop used to be keychain. Keychain is a simple wrapper for ssh-agent and gpg-agent. It eases the use of a single long running agent per system instead of per login session. For some reason this tool had fallen out of my basket when I switched to debian several years ago.</description>

      <description>I am in the process of setting up one of my new servers. Yes my old dual pIII machines are going to retire. They are going to live in a &amp;#8220;retirement community&amp;#8221; :P. Any way This time around I am going to use a mirror to protect my data. I never experienced a hardware failure before but I figure better safe than sorry right? So I am going to outline the steps needed to boot from a RAID0.</description>
