      <description>I love how there is all of this squabbling about what the definition of broadband is.
&amp;#8220;The Commission should continue to look at maximum advertised speed rather than some measure of &amp;#8216;actual&amp;#8217; speed,&amp;#8221;
and
consumers have “access to broadband capability” whenever they have the opportunity to
purchase services and equipment that enable them to access the Internet at any time and use the
types of applications that are most commonly used today, such as e-mail and web browsing.</description>
