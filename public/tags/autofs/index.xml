      <description>Why do applications have such horrible error messages. Non-specific errors are really not any more helpful than not logging at all.&#xA;I was recently setting up autofs for mounting home directories from an nfs server. The little buggers refused to work right. All I was seeing in the logfile was a notice that an attempt was made, and failed.&#xA;attempting to mount entry /home/nanderso&#xD;failed to mount /home/nanderso&#xD;How helpful is that?</description>
