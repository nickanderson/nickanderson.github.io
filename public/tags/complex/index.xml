      <description>I liked this, so I thought I would share. Found on the inter-webs.
Something that is complex can be broken down into simple parts, without being simple itself. This allows mostly smooth functioning with solvable problems.
Something that is complicated cannot be broken down into simple parts, for it is made of complicated parts. &amp;#8220;Complicated&amp;#8221; is indicative of something that is problematic, convoluted, difficult and inconsistent.
The difference can be made by imagining a piece of string tied to be a circle.</description>
