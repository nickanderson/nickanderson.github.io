      <title>Quick Tip: Drilling into zenoss data with zendmd</title>

      <description>Sometimes you want to know what value zenoss has for something. The numbers sent in alerts seem to be the value that zenoss has, but the graphs are usually formatted to make more sense. 1394606080 might come in an alert, but on the graph it would show as 1.3 or 1.4G. It can cause some slight confusion when other people expect 90% of 1.4G instead of 90% of 1394606080 to be an alert threshold.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading the final release of Diego Zambonis&amp;#8217; Learning CFEngine 3. I can&amp;#8217;t recommend this book enough. If your just learning CFEngine 3, if you are versed but not an expert and you like CFEngine you will like this book. If you meet all those criteria and you don&amp;#8217;t like the book, I&amp;#8217;ll buy you a beer if we ever meet. It&amp;#8217;s well worth the 20 dollars, or 14 if you want the ebook (DRM FREE!</description>

      <description>Here is an easy way to configure encfs with dropbox that is compatible with boxcryptor. Boxcryptor makes Windows, Mac Android, and IOS applications to assist you in accessing data that you have stored in encfs. They do require that you create your encfs with some specific options: Cipher algorithm: AES, Plaintext or Stream encrypted filenames, No filename initialization vector chaining, No per-file initialization vectors, No external IV chaining, No block MAC headers, No per-block random bytes.</description>

      <title>New bundle to manage routes for RedHat/CentOS with CFEngine 3</title>

      <description>I re-factored rh_add_interface_routes into a new bundle rh_update_routes, you can find them in my CFEngine library.
The biggest improvement is you no longer have to specify the interface you want the route on. Instead you specify a regular expression of the ip that would be on that interface and the specific interface is found.
Second major improvement is the direct use of ip route del/add to update currently running system instead of restarting all networking.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I am not so disciplined to run cf-promises on my policy before I commit it. I make a small change and I think I&amp;#8217;m golden, but inevitably that breaks things. I wrote a simple commit hook to check policy syntax and stop you from shooting yourself in the foot. You can findÂ the pre-commit{#a71b90d9d3bb7e4d1f4be225eb124c42527855a3} script over on my github account. I hope you find it useful.</description>

      <description>I am happy to see how many sites are participating in the SOPA/PIPA protest today. I am a bit disapointed that facebook did not join (at least yet), and google only doing a doodle seems a little bit on the weak side. Still its nice when so many people can show support for something so threatening. There is quite a list of sites that are blacked out in one way or another today.</description>

      <description>I just wanted to share my NetApp customer service experience since usually people only share negative experiences. I needed to download a mib for a NetApp today. I really don&amp;#8217;t like that I have to register an account just to download a mib but whatever. I was really upset after registering the account and entering a system-id to find that I didn&amp;#8217;t have access to download any mibs.
I saw that feedback button glaring at me so decided to give it a shot, left a &amp;#8220;very dissatisfied&amp;#8221; about download experience review.</description>

      <description>That&amp;#8217;s right the Mentorship Program is turning 1. Like any youngster we&amp;#8217;re still learning our place in the world. We have had growing pains but we still have a bright future. In the past year we have had three program chairs Jesse Trucks, Ian Parades, and Thomas Leyer (current chair). The core team consists of Lois Bennett, Thomas Leyer and me. I&amp;#8217;d like to share some statistics with you.

      <description>Well I gave unity the old college try in ubuntu 11.04. But last night I just couldn&amp;#8217;t take it any more. There were some small rendering issues occasionally plus some tray programs like workrave had no place to go, at least that I could find anyway and I really need workrave to remind me to change from sitting to standing positions every so often.
At any rate I decided to try gnome3 and gnome-shell.</description>

      <description>April 1st. I had a fairly eventful day, first I found that the phone system at $work has been mis-configured since it was installed. Second I got a call from someone I had worked with a few years back about a system that did not have backups that had a raid hiccup tanking the system a few days ago needing help with a restore.

      <description>I know I have been pretty silent for a while, what can I say it has been busy. I did want to drop this little tip though. I use vim and gnome-terminal a LOT, so I hit ESC quite frequently. Being so close to the F1 key can be hazardous as I tend to mash the ESC key several times. I have no idea where I picked up the habbit of hitting ESC multiple times but its something I have done for a long time and I don&amp;#8217;t see me retraining myself any time soon.</description>

First you need to set ï»¿ï»¿gecko.handlerService.allowRegisterFromDifferentHost to true in about:config (type about:config into your address bar).</description>

      <description>When you get started as a SysAdmin you typically fall into one of 10 categories. You either had a mentor to show you the ropes, or you dredged through it on your on. It seems more and more the group that had or has a mentor is shrinking. I never had a mentor for the things I was most interested in, but my first boss did give good advice, and his words seem to ring in my head often.</description>

      <description>Just a little tip, if your looking for bind stats and your chrooted
rndc stats will give you
rndc: &#39;stats&#39; failed: permission denied All you have to do is
touch /var/named/chroot/var/named/named.stats chown named:named /var/named/chroot/var/named/named.stats Now after you run rndc stats your named.stats fill will be populated with information.</description>

      <description>Had a slightly vexing issue the other day. During a migration the destination host ended up caching some stale DNS entries. I tried a quick restart of nscd to no avail, rebooted the VM, again no joy. Even overriding the host in /etc/hosts wasn&amp;#8217;t working. Took a few minutes of digging but what did work was
nscd -i hosts . Just something to remember if you ever seem to have a stubborn caching issue, rebooting/restarting wont always solve the issue.</description>

      <description>IMHO one of the great benefits of virtualization is the ability to properly size your guests. Many times 512M memory and an 8G / is plenty. Increasing memory for a virtual machine is typically pretty straight forward, but there are several options when adding disk space. Mounting the space in the file system and doing something with LVM are likely the most common paths.
Depending on the situation I typically lean toward keeping my small 8G root and mounting extra storage where needed in the file system.</description>

Vivendi Universal forgot to renew its MP3.com in 2003, the Washington Post forgot to renew in 2004, and Foursquare forgot to renew their domain in 2010.
I stumbled on the check_domain nagios plugin this weekend so I figured I would make some quick modifications and roll it into a Zenpack.</description>

      <description>Nginx is a great little web server. I have posted previously about using it as a reverse proxy. Weather your using it as a reverse proxy or as a normal webserver you will probably eventually want to know what its doing over time so you can adjust resources as necessary.
The other day I threw together a Zenpack to make it easier to setup monitoring on new Zenoss instances. It contains a command data source &amp;#8220;check_nginx_ng&amp;#8221; which is a slightly modified version of Chris Kellys check_nginx_ng which in turn was based on check_nginx by Mike Adolphs.</description>

      <description>Why do applications have such horrible error messages. Non-specific errors are really not any more helpful than not logging at all.
I was recently setting up autofs for mounting home directories from an nfs server. The little buggers refused to work right. All I was seeing in the logfile was a notice that an attempt was made, and failed.
attempting to mount entry /home/nanderso failed to mount /home/nanderso   How helpful is that?</description>

      <description>Recently I was building a ZenPack for Zenoss. The ZenPack included an Event Command which executed a custom script. I wanted to store the custom script in the ZenPack and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do anything other than have proper script dependencies in place for it to work.

      <description>I came across a new blog (seems to have come on-line in March) http://www.epoxyjournal.com. One of the entries was about how to clear command history. Everyone has inadvertently pasted or typed something into the wrong shell. Sometimes its worthwhile to clean up after yourself and sometimes its not. I figured I would offer a suggestion for the times you want to avoid having your embarrassing moments in your ~/.bash_history.
Instead of blowing away your entire current buffer with history -c you can redirect it to another file, flush the buffer to the file, clean it up then append it to your ~/.</description>

      <description>I have a love/hate relationship with cpanel. On one hand it makes low end hosting a breeze, on the other its a huge pita if you want to do anything &amp;#8220;outside the box&amp;#8221;. Perhaps it&amp;#8217;s not such a pain if you work with cpanel frequently. But I find cpanel beneficial because it aids in tasks that I don&amp;#8217;t do frequently, and can offload many of those tasks to less technical people.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m curious what anyone who reads this blog thinks. My first reaction when someone mentions Ubuntu server is to grab the nearest trout and start slapping. Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong I like Ubuntu. It&amp;#8217;s very nice on a workstation, and suitable for my wife, mother, aunt, etc &amp;#8230;. But do you really think its good enough for prime time in the data center? According to a server-survey conducted by the Ubuntu marketing team almost 80% of users see Ubuntu as ready for mission critical use.</description>

      <description>Monitoring and analyzing performance is an important task for any sysadmin. Disk I/O bottlenecks can bring applications to a crawl. What are IOPS?Â Should I use SATA, SAS, or FC? How many spindles do I need? What RAID level should I use? Is my system read or write heavy? These are common questions for anyone embarking on an disk I/O analysis quest. Obligatory disclaimer: I do not consider myself an expert in storage or anything for that mater.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think I bothered to complain here but I sure sent my fair share of nasty grams. In fact Dell became one of my four letter words after I heard they were firmware locking Gen11 servers to only dell drives. Of course it was a mistake but I loved to unashamedly repeat the famous quote from Howard Shoobe.
 &amp;#8220;There are a number of benefits for using Dell qualified drives in particular ensuring a positive experience and protecting our data.</description>

      <description>Recently a developer came to me and said they are starting to see failed builds apparently due to open file handle limitations on the build server. In case your not aware, by default there are limitations on users to ensure they don&amp;#8217;t hog the entire resources of a system. Sometimes these limitations need to be adjusted.
In my case the &amp;#8220;bamboo&amp;#8221; user needed more than 1024 open files on occasion. I determined my system had a maximum number of open files of 1572928.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of OSX and I try to avoid it with the same veracity that I avoid Windows. But I recently needed to have a Linux NFS export mounted on an OSX server. A simple mount server:/export /mymountpoint didn&amp;#8217;t work and returned &amp;#8220;Operation not permitted&amp;#8221;. After a bit of digging I found the solution.
I needed to instruct the client to use a privledged port by adding the &amp;#8220;-P&amp;#8221; option.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know how many of you know that I am a recovering gentoo user. One of the staples of my desktop used to be keychain. Keychain is a simple wrapper for ssh-agent and gpg-agent. It eases the use of a single long running agent per system instead of per login session. For some reason this tool had fallen out of my basket when I switched to debian several years ago.</description>

      <description>Besides the gui/vnc consoles you can still use the equivlent of xm console in Citrix XenServer.
On the host console:
 xe vm-list to get the list of domins running (just note the uuid of the domain you want). list_domains will list the domain name and the uuid of the domains. Match up your uuid so you get the proper dom_id xm console equivlent is /usr/lib/xen/bin/xenconsole dom_id  Its not in the root users $PATH though I think it ought to be.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;#8217;t even start with me about how telnet is horrid. Out side of my control but I recently had issues trying to enable telnet on a server. Typically its pretty straightforward.
 yum install telnet-server chkconfig telnet on chkconfig xinetd on service xinetd start  Unfortunately for me this was not working. Every time I tried to telnet to the host after enabling it I would get an error message.</description>

The first thing I tried to do after determining the commands I needed was to shove the commands in with ssh directly.Â I quickly became apparent that route just wasn&amp;#8217;t going to work.
When you log into the iLOM &amp;#8220;daemons&amp;#8221; need to initialize.</description>

      <description>I know I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned how much I love the sysstat package before. I use sar regularly to help with performance diagnostics (Analyzing Linux System Performance And Finding Bottle Necks,Â CPU Performance Analysis In Linux,Â Baseline Analysis Is Important, CPU Performance Analysis In Linux Revisited). I wrote this little Nagios plugin to collect the performance metrics that sar collects.
I use this plugin with Zenoss and I set any performance thresholds there, more important to me was collecting the information for historical graphing.</description>

      <description>If you hadn&amp;#8217;t already guessed I am a big fan of the Xen hypervisor. Lately I have been using the Citrix XenServer release because it makes it quite palatable for my co-workers. One annoyance that I do have about XenServer is the requirement that you license it (with a free license) every year. If you fail to license it the GUI stops working. Now I hate relying on GUIs but the fact of the matter is others in my team expect to have a working GUI when they need to do something.</description>
