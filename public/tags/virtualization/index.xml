      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are aware of my affinity for the Xen hypervisor. In the last year I have switched over to Citrix Xenserver. With other people managing VMs as well having a nice GUI is helpful. One of my complaints is that the GUI (XenCenter) is a windows only app. C&amp;#8217;mon, Citrix, please release a cross platform management console. I&amp;#8217;ve got to run a windows VM just to use the GUI (granted I don&amp;#8217;t have to use the gui, there is a nice API and console utilities). At any rate today I noticed that I could no longer pull up the console for a windows VM nor could I pull up the performance metrics available in XenCenter. A few searches turned up &lt;a href=&#34;http://kennethhunt.com&#34;&gt;Kenneth Hunts blog&lt;/a&gt; and a post that showed me where to fix it. The windows box running XenCenter has a cache folder located in %AppData%\Citrix\XenCenterMain.exe_Url_xxxxxxxxxx. If you remove the cache you should be able to see the console and performance graphs again. If by chance you remove the entire folder you will need to re-add all dom0s back into XenCenter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today Citrix announced that it will distribute its enterprise packaging of Xen for free. This brings fancy gui management and features available in VMwares ESX server to everyone. (Actually I&amp;#8217;m not clear if just the ability is there or if they actually are letting the gui go as well.)
This is not a scaled down, limited version of the hypervisor. From the end of March on, there will be only one edition of XenServer which and it will be free.</description>
