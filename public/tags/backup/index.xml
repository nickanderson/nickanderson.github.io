      <description>It looks like I will need a windows backup solution for a small project soon. As you probably know I don&amp;#8217;t typically do Windows so I am reaching out. I typically use rsync for most of my backup needs. To be more specific I like to use rsnapshot which is a wrapper around rsync. Have you ever wanted rsync on windows? What did you use.
I am aware of several options.</description>
