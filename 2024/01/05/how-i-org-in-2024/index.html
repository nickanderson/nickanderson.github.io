                    <p>Org-mode is my exocortex, second brain, second mind, mind palace, pensive, and personal knowledge management system. It&rsquo;s very flexible and the features I use as well as how I organize my files continues to change so I collected things here to document how I do things in 2024, I did this in 2023 as well<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Unrealistically or not, I want total recall, to remember everything in durable plain text. I want to have control of my data. I want to do my work and interact efficiently. I want to improve my knowledge and capabilities, and I want to be able to share with others.</p>
<p>On the best of days I never leave Emacs and I have a record of everything I did as well as how much time I spent on each thing.</p>
<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<p>As of Monday, January  8, 2024
I had <code>57MB</code> of <code>.org</code> files in <code>~/org</code>. <code>4943</code> files and <code>1195007</code> lines of text, the largest single file was <code>1.3MB</code> and the longest lined file had <code>26370</code> lines.</p>
<p><code>4769</code> of these files were inside Org-roam<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the majority of them (<code>3606</code>) were &ldquo;dailies&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Additionally, <code>~/Syncthing/Orgzly</code> had <code>7.9MB</code> worth of <code>.org</code> files that I synced around to a few devices and the largest <code>.org</code> file was <code>677K</code> with the most lined file having <code>49670</code> lines.</p>

<p>There was no real formal system in use here. Pretty much the Nick Anderson S.H.I.T. (Stuff here &lsquo;n there) methodology.</p>

<p>I appreciated reading about various workflows and methodologies like PARA, CODE, ACCESS, Johnny Decimal, etc &hellip; but I liked to do what works for me, and that has been an ever-changing target. I would say that my process was perhaps most closely aligned with CODE (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express).</p>
<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>
<p>Capturing was an important concept in my workflow. Fundamentally it&rsquo;s grabbing new content and putting it somewhere. It facilitated consistency and automated some tedium of organization. I needed capturing to be fast and not interrupt my flow.</p>
<p>Org-roam was my primary capture interface and I <em>really</em> liked the daily capabilities. Each day I captured notes about everything I was working on into my work log while clocking time. This gave me a nice place to think and process what I was working on<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as well as a place to get my bearings and see what I had been working on when I got side-tracked<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Having a new file each day gave me a fresh start and it helped me to avoid performance issues I had previously experienced with large (multi-megabyte) files.</p>
<p>I had <code>24</code> org-capture-templates,  <code>16</code> org-roam-capture-templates and <code>75</code> org-roam-dailies-capture-templates.</p>
<h3 id="capture-templates-helped-me">Capture templates helped me</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remember relationships between notes. Many included <code>%a</code> to create a link to the node where I was when the capture was initiated with my configuration automatically creating an ID in the source node if necessary. I preferred ID links as they don&rsquo;t break as I move files around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically organize captured content to a sane place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clock time. Only my work log capture template clocks time. Work log entries might contain the details of the work I was doing, or if it&rsquo;s related to work being done over multiple days might link to another node where those details are stored. If I am working on a specific project where time tracking is needed I will manually clock time in the project related files. At times I feel a desire for concurrent clocking but I hadn&rsquo;t made any efforts to see how to implement such capability. Org-mode already provided capabilities to help avoid clocking multiple things concurrently and I hadn&rsquo;t convinced myself that concurrent clocking was really needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialize new files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup nodes for export.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-tools-used-for-capture">Other tools used for capture</h3>
<p>Some of the features that I used to get content into Org-mode were not part of org-capture.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-web-tools</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> to pull web pages into org. Either as a buffer to read, or as a subtree to store.</p>
<p><code>org-rich-yank</code><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> let me copy text and paste it with context allowing it to be syntax highlighted as well as providing a link back to the source.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-jira</code><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> to pull issues from Atlassian Cloud Jira into org-mode</p>

<p>Org-roam is a plain-text personal knowledge management system. According to the <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Introduction">introduction in the manual</a> Org-roam is a tool for networked thought. It reproduces some of <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research’</a>s key features within Org-mode. Org-roam allows for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking: with Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking fun and easy. Really, it facilitates capturing information by extending Org-mode&rsquo;s existing capture system, maintains a sqlite database of nodes (headings) with IDs and other metadata and provides the ability to surface and navigate back links (which nodes link to the current node). <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">https://www.orgroam.com/</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><code>org-rich-yank</code> doesn&rsquo;t get enough publicity, I used it many times a day. It pastes the last copied text and automatically surrounds the snippet in blocks, marked with the major mode of where the code came from, and adds a link to the source file after the block. I recommend customizing <code>org-rich-yank-format-paste</code> and making the link to the source a comment as described in the README. <a href="https://github.com/unhammer/org-rich-yank">https://github.com/unhammer/org-rich-yank</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
