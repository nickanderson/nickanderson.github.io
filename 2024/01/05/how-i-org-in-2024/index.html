<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<p>As of Monday, June  3, 2024
I had <code>62MB</code> of <code>.org</code> files in <code>~/org</code>. <code>5441</code> files and <code>1289699</code> lines of text, the largest single file was <code>1.4MB</code> and the longest lined file had <code>26370</code> lines.</p>
<p><code>5412</code> of these files were inside Org-roam<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the majority of them (<code>3940</code>) were &ldquo;dailies&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. There were <code>16670</code> nodes in total, so about <code>3</code> nodes per file. This seemed accurate since many headlines (I had <code>58212</code> headlines) didn&rsquo;t have IDs. IDs got created automatically when I stored a link (which often happened during capture) or attached a file.</p>

<h2 id="system">System</h2>
<p>There was no real formal system in use here. Pretty much the Nick Anderson S.H.I.T. (Stuff here &rsquo;n there) methodology.</p>

<p>I appreciated reading about various workflows and methodologies like PARA, CODE, ACCESS, Johnny Decimal, etc &hellip; but I liked to do what works for me, and that has been an ever-changing target. I would say that my process was perhaps most closely aligned with CODE (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express).</p>
<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>
<p>Capturing was an important concept in my workflow. Fundamentally it&rsquo;s grabbing new content and putting it somewhere. It facilitated consistency and automated some tedium of organization. I needed capturing to be fast and not interrupt my flow.</p>
<p>Org-roam was my primary capture interface and I <em>really</em> liked the daily capabilities. Each day I captured notes about everything I was working on into my work log while clocking time. This gave me a nice place to think and process what I was working on<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as well as a place to get my bearings and see what I had been working on when I got side-tracked<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Having a new file each day gave me a fresh start and it helped me to avoid performance issues I had previously experienced with large (multi-megabyte) files.</p>
<p>I had <code>24</code> org-capture-templates,  <code>19</code> org-roam-capture-templates and <code>78</code> org-roam-dailies-capture-templates.</p>

<h3 id="capture-templates-helped-me">Capture templates helped me</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Remember relationships between notes.</strong> Many included <code>%a</code> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> to create a link to the node where I was when the capture was initiated with my configuration automatically creating an ID in the source node if necessary. I preferred ID links as they don&rsquo;t break as I move files around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatically organize captured content.</strong> I capture to my work log the most, but as I identify recurring similar content I create templates to ensure like content is stored together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Track time spent.</strong> Only my work log capture template clocks time. Work log entries might contain the details of the work I was doing, or if it&rsquo;s related to work being done over multiple days might link to another node where those details are stored. If I am working on a specific project where time tracking is needed I will manually clock time in the project related files. At times I feel a desire for concurrent clocking but I hadn&rsquo;t made any efforts to see how to implement such capability. Org-mode already provided capabilities to help avoid clocking multiple things concurrently and I hadn&rsquo;t convinced myself that concurrent clocking was really needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize new files.</strong> Org-mode can create new files and the outline path to the captured node, but alone it has no capability to initialize content outside the capture target. Org-roam&rsquo;s capture templates have the ability to initialize the reset of the file if target file does not already exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup nodes for export.</strong> For many of my recurring meetings I like to send out my notes to my team. My capture templates initialize the mail related properties so that I can easily export and sent my note via email.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-tools-used-for-capture">Other tools used for capture</h3>
<p>Some of the features that I used to get content into Org-mode were not part of org-capture.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-rich-yank</code><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> often, which let me copy text and paste it with context allowing it to be syntax highlighted as well as providing a link back to the source.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I read email in <code>mu4e</code>, simply being inside of Emacs that facilitate getting emails into org-mode.</p>
<p>I occasionally used <code>org-web-tools</code><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> to pull web pages into org. Either as a buffer to read, or as a subtree to store.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I wanted to clip a bit of text from a web page I used <code>org-protocol</code><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> bookmarklets to get the content into Emacs.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-jira</code><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> to pull issues from Atlassian Cloud Jira into org-mode.</p>
<p>I used <code>gif-screencast</code> <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> to record many of the animations found on this page.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-download</code> <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>to facilitate dragging things onto my buffer to attach them and downloading files (usually images) as attachments. It provided a screenshot tool but I didn&rsquo;t tend to use it.</p>
<p>I occasionally used some <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/04/org-mode-insert-youtube-video-with-separate-captions/">elisp from sachachua&rsquo;s</a> <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>blog to download youtube videos with their transcripts.</p>
<p>I had some memacs jobs running, but no plan for using the data. It felt like getting comfortable with agenda was perhaps a pre-requisite for value.</p>
<h2 id="retrieval">Retrieval</h2>
<p>I retrieved content from my org in a myriad of ways.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-roam-goto-today</code> usually keying in <code>wll</code> (work log log) frequently to get back to home base.</p>
<p>Often I would find notes by name using <code>org-roam-node-find</code>. This worked well for finding notes with a regular naming pattern, e.g. I took notes on the work I did while releasing new software versions. The capture template for that type of note created files titled <code>Release work for X</code>, so it was quick and easy to <code>org-roam-node-find</code>, type <code>Release work for 3.18.7</code>, and jump to that note. Similarly, I kept notes on individual people, those notes were titled with the persons name, so it was quick to <code>org-roam-node-find</code> and start typing the persons name to find their note.</p>
<p>I frequently found notes via link. <code>org-roam-node-insert</code> made it easy to simply insert a link to another note (found by name as noted above) which I could then jump follow.  Many of my capture templates also contain links, some to well known related notes and some using <code>%a</code> <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> to provide a link to the location I was when I decided to initiate the capture. So, when I wanted to find the notes for the ticket I was working on the day prior I would visit the worklog for the day and find the headline where I was clocking time related to the ticket and follow the link to the ticket notes. That annotation link (<code>%a</code>) can result in links to unrelated things, but I had found the ability to track back and be aware of unrelated things that were happening around that time to be useful during some archaeology sessions.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would use <code>org-roam-buffer</code> to get a view on which notes link to my current note.</p>
<p>Searching by name is not always effective, sometimes I needed to search widely and dive deep searching for specific strings. For that, most often I used <code>org-ripgrep-consult</code>.</p>
<p>For serendipitous stumbles, I occasionally used <code>org-roam-random-note</code> to surface some random note.</p>
<p>I long desired to make effective use of <code>org-agenda</code> and I had played around with using <code>org-roam-db-query</code> to identify which files contained TODO keywords to keep the files loaded by <code>org-agenda</code> to a minimum, but I had yet to really make agenda part of my routine. I also tried using <code>org-idle-agenda</code> to keep bringing it front and center but I struggled to get comfortable.</p>
<p>I revisited <code>org-ql</code> in early February and found a patch that enabled specifying multiple files to use as source for the query. I combined this with a poorly written elisp function that returns the last 3 months worth of worklog files (the same function that I use for clocktables). This felt like a less ephermal agenda. I liked the pain textness of it, how I wouldn&rsquo;t need emacs to view yesterdays agenda simply by looking at yesterdays worklog. So it quickly became part of my daily workflow. I added an org-ql dynamic block to my daily worklog template giving me a quick idea of things I should focus on. It did really highlight the cases where I end up with multiple todos for the same item across multiple files so I needed to figure out how I wanted to improve that. I was considering canceling todos from prior days when I chose to pick it up in a new todo, or moving the heading forward, or adding a new todo state for carried over, or expanding the scope of the query to look in other places but knowing where to look is tricky, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I even needed to worry about volume of files, it&rsquo;s not agenda after all.</p>
<p><code>org-roam-dynamic-blocks</code> <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> stayed on my radar, but I had yet to really make it an active part of my workflow.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Output was a very important aspect of my system. It was important to me to be able to easily share my knowledge and experience with others.</p>
<p>I used <code>org-babel</code> frequently. It was very convenient and efficient to be able to execute code directly in my documents.</p>
<p>Copying and pasting between a console and what I was writing introduced much chance for error. Having code blocks and in-line execution improve the accuracy of my notes and anything else that I was producing.</p>
<p>For example, the Statistics section of this post used inline code blocks and the data was freshly generated each time I exported an updated version with ox-hugo. Named blocks let me inject dynamic content in a sentence and provided easy access for on-demand execution, not to mention the ability to leveraged as input for other blocks.</p>
<p>For some time I had struggled with long running jobs blocking Emacs. I had used ob-async in the past in the prior few years seemed to run into issues with ob-async not working. I also wanted something that would work better for very long running jobs (like 7+ hours). In February I experimented with ob-tmux which was neat, but then I was seeing tmux crash and ended up having better success with ob-screen.</p>
<p>I continued to make more consistent use of <code>org-transclusion</code><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> while authoring content. Instead of duplicating content, copying to a new place I distilled what I want to use into an atomic chunk and then referenced it. I found this is helpful in several ways. It reduced unnecessary growth to the volume of text that I had, reduced the number of duplicate hits for things when I was searching for something, increased the interlinking of my org-mode files providing a more rich experience with <code>org-roam-buffer</code> showing things that used the content as well as interconnected in the <code>org-roam-ui</code> graph visualization.</p>
<p>With so many export backends available I didn&rsquo;t usually have to spend time mucking around with some bespoke syntax. I could author in org-mode and quickly export it to another format. It was nice to have relatively good formatting in many formats with relatively little effort.</p>
<p>I exported using <code>ox-jira</code> and used <code>org-jira</code> to manage issues in Jira Cloud. Again, everyone benefited from well styled comments and ticket descriptions and no real extra effort was required from me.</p>
<p>I made presentations using <code>org-reveal</code> and <code>org-re-reveal</code> with nice features like speaker notes. These presentations could also be printed to PDF. I played with org-present and org-tree-slide but not enough to gain a good level of comfort.</p>
<p>I wrote reports that I exported to ODT for copying and pasting into google drive<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> and PDF for emailing to clients.</p>
<p>I wrote blog posts exporting with <code>ox-hugo</code> to multiple websites using different hugo configurations.</p>
<p>I authored emails in org-mode exported with <code>org-mime</code><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> as a multi-part ASCII &amp; HTML message.</p>
<p><code>abbrev-mode</code> was amazing at auto correcting my most common typos. <code>writegood-mode</code> and <code>olivette</code> were both nice for writing when I remembered to enable them.</p>
<p>gptel was my primary llm interface. I interfaced primarily with local LLMs via Ollama but had Google Gemini and OpenAI configured for use as well. I looked forward to support for image generation (though there was no indication it was coming). I also used chatgpt-shell, org-ai, and ellama from time to time. Sadly Khoj fell by the wayside as I had many issues keeping it functional with their rapid development and architecture changes but I remained hopeful that I would return to it in the future.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>So, how did a day in my org life flow?</p>
<p>Usually my day started with meetings. I liked to take notes and email them to a distribution list afterward<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. For example, a few minutes before my CFEngine stand-up I ran <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-today</code> and keyed in <code>w</code> (work) <code>m</code> (meeting) <code>c</code> (CFEngine) <code>d</code> (daily stand-up). Immediately after activating this capture I triggered another capture for my work log keying in <code>w</code> (work) <code>l</code> (log)<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> which clocked time. With so many templates I used mnemonic key bindings.</p>
<p>The work log capture template included a link to the stand-up note for the day. I followed that link and started filling out my template. The template featured a headline for each person with a property linking to a node for the individual. My section contained a clock table that promptly generated a list of entries with clocked time from the preceding day (on Mondays or days when I had missed several prior days, I adjusted the clock table to retrieve the appropriate number of previous days). I examined the table to assess my performance in clocking the previous day and filled in any gaps that I had neglected to record, then deleted the time columns.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, I used <code>org-mime</code><sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> to prepare a nicely formatted multipart ASCII &amp; HTML email. After sending the mail, I switched back to my work log capture and completed it. All of my regularly scheduled meetings followed the same process; I captured for the meeting template, then I captured to my work log, clocking time with an automatic backlink back to the specific meeting note. It was easy to capture notes for yesterday, tomorrow, or an arbitrary date in the future using <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday</code>, <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow</code>, and <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-date</code>.</p>
<p>When initializing a new daily worklog file the template also included an org-ql dynamic block showing TODO, WAITING, and IN<sub>PROGRESS</sub> tasks from the prior 3 months helping to surface things I had been working on (or intended to work on ) recently that needed follow-up. I liked the less ephermal nature of the dynamic block in comparison to agenda which I continued to struggle getting comfortable with.</p>
<p>Org-roam provided useful functions for accessing time-series notes. <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-today</code> took users to today&rsquo;s note for the selected template. If the file did not exist, it was initialized. Similarly, <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday</code>, <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow</code>, and <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-date</code> took users to the note for yesterday, tomorrow, or the specified date and created the file if necessary. <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-previous</code> and <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-next</code> navigated to the previous and next note in the series based on the file being visited, enabling easy navigation through the time series.</p>
<p><code>org-roam-node-random</code> was fun, as it says, it takes you to a random node. It was nice for serendipitous stumbles but I barely ever used it.</p>
<p>If I worked on something with a regular pattern but it was not a recurring time series, I followed a similar pattern. However, instead of <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code>, I ran <code>org-roam-capture</code>. Unlike <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code>, <code>org-roam-capture</code> prompted me first for a node title and then allowed me to select a template.</p>
<p>For instance, if I worked on a support case, I would run <code>org-roam-capture</code>, enter the issue number, and then key in <code>w</code> (work) <code>s</code> (support). I was taken to a new node in the file for that support case where I immediately triggered <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> for my work log which started clocking time. I followed the link back to the node to continue my work.</p>
<p>For other activities that were typically fast or of uncommon type spanning multiple days, I would run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> and keep notes directly in my past work log.</p>
<p>I authored much of the content in <code>org-mode</code>. I was often able to remain within <code>org-mode</code> and preserved a detailed record of my exact activities. When I needed to execute commands, I typically employed <code>org-babel</code> so that commands, their outputs, and my contemplations formed a substantial log of my work as it progressed. This log was frequently appropriate for direct transmission to others, for which purpose I capitalized on the ample export back ends available<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2>
<p>Going mobile with <code>org mode</code>, I used several different applications:</p>
<p>I utilized Syncthing to synchronize files across devices, syncing a subset of my org files to mobile devices. I didn&rsquo;t require access to my entire exocortex on the go.</p>
<p>Orgzly served as my primary capture tool on mobile. My Orgzly directory was synchronized across all my mobile devices. Each device had a device-specific file configured as the <code>Default notebook.</code></p>
<p>I enjoyed the home screen widget, which displayed a query showing notes from the device-specific file created in the last few days. For note-taking, I used the <code>+</code> button on the home screen widget. There was also a new note option in the notifications drop-down drawer, but I generally refrained from using it.</p>
<p>It was serviceable for short notes, such as <code>Saw Brian at the store; he broke his foot. We should get together and grill</code>, or lists for the store, e.g., <code>TODO Milk :store,</code> <code>TODO Black Beans :store.</code></p>
<p>It simplified managing trips to the store. However, the editing experience was lacking, and I longed for improved capture capabilities. It handled deep directory structures, which wasn&rsquo;t an issue for me but would have been a valuable feature. I missed having this functionality.</p>
<p>I had not encountered sync conflicts since I introduced a Tasker automation to synchronize the Orgzly database on screen wake<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> and adopted the practice of having one capture file per mobile device.</p>
<p>I filed my Orgzly captures to my main system far less often than I should. They were typically transferred to my personal journal. I hoped to eventually implement a function to refile them to a specific org-roam-dailies capture template for the date under point or maybe earliest or latest timestamp.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Other applications that I used on mobile that deserve mention:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Logseq</dt>
<dd>I really liked how daily files are featured. I missed a capture capability. I disliked how the share to target is not stable. It shared to the insertion point. So if the app was open in the background that share might have gone to some random place I stopped writing. It was convenient at times, but other times very inconvenient. I didn&rsquo;t love the editing interface. Everything was a headline, so it&rsquo;s a bit ugly when I come to the file in Emacs. I mostly used it in experiments to help a colleague get more from their use. Unfortunately, it seems they are shifting to a db first model so it&rsquo;s futures alignment with my priorities were in question.</dd>
<dt>Metanote</dt>
<dd>I didn&rsquo;t see other people mention this one often. I had found it to be a bit slow but the editing UI was not bad. Also, it had a few capture templates as well as Agenda.</dd>
<dt>Orgro</dt>
<dd>No longer a read only tool, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it&rsquo;s edit capabilities.</dd>

<p>I came across org-node by way of a <a href="https://emacs.ch/@meedstrom/112351784622309609">post on Mastadon</a> near the end of April. It&rsquo;s an org-roam work-a-like, but avoids the database using <code>rg</code> and some custom caching. It&rsquo;s id centric, which would be a good fit for me.</p>
<p>I played with it a bit and intend to keep trying it out but my current org-roam-node-find works well for me. It&rsquo;s fast enough and faster than what I am getting from org-node so far. I don&rsquo;t have any issue with org-roam using sqlite, but the thought of having similar basic functionality without need for that extra bit is one I like.</p>
