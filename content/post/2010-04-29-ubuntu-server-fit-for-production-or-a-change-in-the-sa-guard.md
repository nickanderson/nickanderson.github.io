I&#8217;m curious what anyone who reads this blog thinks. My first reaction when someone mentions Ubuntu server is to grab the nearest trout and start slapping. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I like Ubuntu. It&#8217;s very nice on a workstation, and suitable for my wife, mother, aunt, etc &#8230;. But do you really think its good enough for prime time in the data center? According to a [server-survey conducted by the Ubuntu marketing team][1] almost 80% of users see Ubuntu as ready for mission critical use.

I was quite shocked when I first saw that. Then I dug a bit deeper. Turns out they announced surveys &#8220;variety of Ubuntu forums, websites and other channels&#8221;. They do note that &#8220;consequently, the results are focuses on Ubuntu users and not general Linux users&#8221;. I am not saying that I would \_never\_ run Ubuntu as a server. I just don&#8217;t think its proven itself yet. Perhaps in another LTS release or two I may consider it. I also know there is a chicken and egg paradox there. It of course won&#8217;t prove itself until people start putting it to the test.

I think this also brings up another interesting point. The survey noted that &#8220;95% of respondents considered hardware support as important to very important&#8221;. Included in the survey was a chart that listed Ubuntu users hardware preferences. Not surprisingly Tower/Desktop PC topped the list, but Dell servers, HP/Compaq x86 Servers, IBM x86 servers, and SUN x86_64 servers were also on the list. At the time of the report &#8220;Ubuntu Server Edition did not come pre-installed on machines from any major provider&#8221;. What happened to the desire for &#8220;Enterprise Support&#8221;?

I have long been greatly annoyed by &#8220;Enterprise Support&#8221;. More often than not it just gets in my way and to stay supported I have to do things in a less than optimal way. It would not hurt my feelings if the demand for &#8220;Enterprise Support&#8221; decreased and the demand for &#8220;knowledgeable individuals&#8221; increased. I would love to take the money spent on &#8220;Enterprise Support&#8221; and channel it back into training. Unfortunately I just don&#8217;t see that happening.

So what do you think? Do you think Ubuntu is ready for production? What does the lack of vendor support say about Ubuntu or the direction of &#8220;Enterprise Support&#8221; needs? Are you running Ubuntu in production (for anything serious, not your home server &#8230;)? Have any good or bad Ubuntu server stories to share?
