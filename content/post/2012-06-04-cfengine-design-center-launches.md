You may not have noticed that the [CFEngine Design Center][3] also launched.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am excited about the new [25 free enterprise nodes][4] and the new features in the Enterprise edition, but I see greater value in the Design Center. This is a great resource for new and old users. Wrap up common tasks in modularized bundles and shove the details out of sight. Not only is it a place to find reusable policy to accomplish a specific task but its also a wealth of policy to look at when designing your own infrastructure. Benefit from others contributions and support the community by contributing policy or even bug reports.
