I make a small change and I think I&#8217;m golden, but inevitably that breaks things. I wrote a simple commit hook to check policy syntax and stop you from shooting yourself in the foot. You can findÂ  the [pre-commit][2]{#a71b90d9d3bb7e4d1f4be225eb124c42527855a3} script over on [my github account][3]. I hope you find it useful.
