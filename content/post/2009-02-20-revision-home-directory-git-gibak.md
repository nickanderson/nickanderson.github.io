Over the last couple days I&#8217;ve briefly talked about [revisioning configs][1] and [making your home directory portable][2]. It seems to have stirred up a bit of discussion over at [Matt Simmons Standalone Sysadmin][3], and [Hugh Browns mentioned he uses mercurial][4] for this task.. As I noted in the post about [managing /etc with version control][1] I do revision my home directory, or at least pieces of it.<!--more-->


  
I consider this to be a different problem than [making my environment portable][2]. For example I want my configs to have a full revision history, even things like my ssh config or my private keys. I want that history as a backup, I do not want to distribute all of that information to other machines. [gibak][5] is a great wrapper for git to help with this.
  
Installation is not hard but you will need to install a few dependencies.

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">aptitude install ocaml omake git-core
git clone http://eigenclass.org/repos/git/gibak/.git/
cd gibak
omake
cp find-git-files ~/bin
cp find-git-repos ~/bin
cp gibak ~/bin
cp ometastore ~/bin
</pre>

Now that its installed you just need to initialize your git repo, make adjustments to your .gitignore (you probably don&#8217;t want \_everything\_ in your repo).

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">gibak init
vim ~/.gitignore
gibak commit
</pre>

I don&#8217;t have everything in my home directory revisioned. Mainly I revision configuration files and my Documents. Here is what my .gitignore looks like.

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title=""># I am selective about what I want to revision, you may not want this.
/*
# You probably want to ignore all the "dot" files in your home
# directory, since they mostly contain local application state data.
/.*
# but... some dot files you probably do *not* want ignored are
# listed here:
!/.bash*
!/.gnupg
!/.ssh
!/.vimrc
!/.mutt
/.mutt/profile.d/*/cache
!/.gitignore
!/.todocycle
!/Documents
</pre>

Now depending on what files you want in your repo and if they change frequently or not you may want to have a cron job to automatically commit changes to your repo. I would suggest an entry similar to this.

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">0 0 * * * gibak commitÂ  "Automatic Commit - $(date +%m.%d.%Y)"
</pre>

To manually commit changes just run gibak commit after making changes.

Now you can deal with your revisioned files just like any other git repo. You can clone it to a remote location to back it up, revert commits or whatever else suits your fancy.
