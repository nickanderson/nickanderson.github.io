I don&#8217;t think I bothered to complain here but I sure sent my fair share of nasty grams. In fact Dell became one of my four letter words after I heard they were [firmware locking Gen11 servers to only dell drives][1]. Of course it was a mistake but I loved to unashamedly repeat the famous quote from Howard Shoobe.

> &#8220;There are a number of benefits for using Dell qualified drives in particular ensuring a positive experience and protecting our data.&#8221; 

While I wish they had not tried to do this in the first place, I do want to be sure to give kudos to Dell for listening to reason. Matt Simmons is reporting that [Dell is reversing its position on 3rd party drives][2]. From the post:

> DELL H-SERIES CONTROLLER BLOCKING OF 3RD PARTY DRIVES
  
> TO BE REMOVED IN Q2FY11
> 
> At Dell, we are committed to our customers. We listen to our customers. And, to ensure our customers have a positive experience with our products, we validate and certify all of our PowerEdge servers and components.
> 
> Previously, Dell prevented the use of non-Dell hard drives attached to PERC H700 and H800 controllers in our 11th generation of PowerEdge servers as we could not certify these non-Dell drives. However, based on customer feedback, we are now reversing this decision and allowing their use (without support).
> 
> Dell will no longer prevent customer use of non-Dell hard drives attached to PERC H700 and H800 controllers on our 11th generation of PowerEdge servers. A Q2FY11 PERC Firmware Update is planned to allow non-Dell hard drives to be used with these controllers.
> 
> We strongly recommend choosing Dell drives as we have validated and certified our drives and can support any issues that may arise.

Dell, welcome back to my approved vendor list.
