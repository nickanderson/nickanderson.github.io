I want to take a minute to thank Thomas Leyer for all of his hard work and dedicated service to the LOPSA Mentorship Program Team. Thomas has been a volunteer since the programs inception, and has chaired the program for the past three years! Thanks Thomas!

You should consider participating. It&#8217;s a great experience whether you choose to participate in the core team, as a mentor or as a <span>protégé, I guarantee you will learn something, and you will be affecting the future of the profession. A round of applause for Thomas and his years of service, and to the current LOPSA Mentorship Program Team. Keep up the good work!<br /> </span>
