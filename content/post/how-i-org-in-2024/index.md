Org-mode is my exocortex, second brain, second mind, mind palace, pensive, and personal knowledge management system. It's very flexible and the features I use as well as how I organize my files continues to change so I collected things here to document how I do things in 2024, I did this in 2023 as well[^fn:1].


## Goal {#goal}

Unrealistically or not, I want total recall, to remember everything in durable plain text. I want to have control of my data. I want to do my work and interact efficiently. I want to improve my knowledge and capabilities, and I want to be able to share with others.

On the best of days I never leave Emacs and I have a record of everything I did as well as how much time I spent on each thing.


## Statistics {#statistics}

As of Friday, January  5, 2024
 I had `57MB` of `.org` files in `~/org`. That's `4939` files and `1194682` lines of text, the largest single file was `1.3M` and the longest lined file was `26370` lines.

`4769` of these files were inside Org-roam[^fn:2], the majority of them (`3602`) were "dailies"[^fn:3].

Additionally, `~/Syncthing/Orgzly` had `7.9MB` worth of `.org` files that I synced around to a few devices and the largest `.org` file was `677K` with the most lined file having `49670` lines.

## System {#system}

There was no real formal system in use here. Pretty much the Nick Anderson S.H.I.T. (Stuff here 'n there) methodology.

I appreciated reading about various workflows and methodologies like PARA, CODE, ACCESS, Johnny Decimal, etc ... but I like to do what works for me, and that's an ever-changing target.

[^fn:2]: Org-roam is a plain-text personal knowledge management system. Really, it facilitates capturing information by extending Org-mode's existing capture system, maintains a sqlite database of nodes (headings) with IDs and other metadata and provides the ability to surface and navigate back links (which nodes link to the current node). <https://www.orgroam.com/>
[^fn:3]: Org-roam dailies are files organized by date. I use them for my journal, work log, and recurring meetings.
