Today I woke up to another abrupt Google change, the background image. I know some people want so much candy they can&#8217;t see the cane. Some of these changes Google has been making lately makes me wonder if the next time I open up vanilla ice cream I will be looking at a tub of Rocky Road. Yes, the background is only there for a day as publicity for the new feature to make Google more bingesque but I would be pretty upset if my vanilla ice cream turned to Rocky Road as well, even if only for a day.
