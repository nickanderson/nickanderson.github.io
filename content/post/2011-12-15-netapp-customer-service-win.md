I needed to download a mib for a NetApp today. I really don&#8217;t like that I have to register an account just to download a mib but whatever. I was really upset after registering the account and entering a system-id to find that I didn&#8217;t have access to download any mibs.

I saw that feedback button glaring at me so decided to give it a shot, left a &#8220;very dissatisfied&#8221; about download experience review. Within an hour I had an email that my access had been changed, and I now have access to download the mibs.

Good job NetApp, in my experience those feedback forms usually go unanswered.
