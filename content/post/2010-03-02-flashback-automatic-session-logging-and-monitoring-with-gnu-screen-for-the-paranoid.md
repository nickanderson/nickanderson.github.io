Another day, another flashback. I don&#8217;t know about you but at times I have had some very odd and uncomfortable requests from vendors. It&#8217;s not whollyÂ  uncommon for them to want to log into your system to diagnose an issue for themselves. Or perhaps for whatever reason your manager says hey give this random outside person access to some important box. As a SA you get used to extremely odd requests and figure out how to [just solve the problem][1]. This flashback outlines what I did the last time I had to let an untrusted (note I had no reason to \_not\_ trust this person, but then again I also had no reason \_to\_ trust them) person have elevated privileges on a box of mine.
