In case you weren&#8217;t paying attention in the last few weeks, today is the [12th annual System Administrator Appreciation Day][1]. It&#8217;s always the last Friday in July. A good reminder to not make changes on Fridays so you can stay out drinking with your colleagues.

There are several places having meet-ups, if your near one or are in a position to make a day trip to one I am sure any of them would love to have you.

  * Â [Los Angeles, CA][2]
  * [NYC, NY][3]
  * [Columbus, OH][4]
  * [San Francisco, CA][5]
  * [Chicago, IL][6]
  * [Buenos Aires, Argentina][7]
