Anyone interested in organizing [[http://kansaslinuxfest.org/][Kansas Linux Fest]] in 2018?

In 2016 and 2017 KLF was hosted in Wichita KS at Wichita State University. The
prior two years organizers are a bit burned out and are taking a break.

<ben_roose> Hi nickanderson, Sadly at the moment there is not a KLF 2018
            planned. The few of us who created KLF 2017 are rather burned out
            and need a break this year :-(
<ben_roose> However, if we can find some new people who are willing to take it
            on either in Wichita or somewhere else in Kansas, then we would be
            more than happy to assist in the infrastructure side and to
            consult as part of the conference ...but as of now, we have not
            found any one new who wishes to take on this task for KLF 2018
