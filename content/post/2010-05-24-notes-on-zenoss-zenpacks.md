Recently I was building a ZenPack for [Zenoss][1]. The ZenPack included an Event Command which executed a custom script. I wanted to store the custom script in the ZenPack and I didn&#8217;t want to do anything other than have proper script dependencies in place for it to work.

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">${here/ZenPackManager/packs/ZenPacks.community.YOURZENPACK/path}/libexec/yourscript.shÂ  ${dev/manageIp}

</pre>

Custom scripts can be placed in $ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.CompanyName.Package/Zenpacks/CompanyName/Package/lib but if you want them to be executable place them in libexec.

Thanks to [Matt Ray][2] for telling me how to properly path the Event Command and the note about scripts in libexec getting the executable bit set, the docs I found only specified the lib directory.
