It's easy to export an org document to html and get a table of contents, but
sometimes it's nice to have a table of contents inside of an org-mode file. The
=[[https://github.com/snosov1/toc-org][toc-org]]= package makes this automatic.

Simply tag a headline with =:TOC:= and the headline will auto fill an index with
all following headlines.
