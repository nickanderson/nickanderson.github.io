			<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Im sure everyone is familiar with smb messages especially as everyone was assulted with them about 10 years ago (stupid soho routers and spammers unite!). Anyway, there are clients for linux like Linpopup. Well recently I didnâ€™t want to use one of those to be able to send messages to my linux workstations so I cobbled together a simple network popup app with python.</p></p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I just wanted to make sure no one forgets that wildcards can be used in your .ssh/config. This can be extremely helpful. For example say you have 100 nodes that have a simple nameing scheme of nodexxxx. You can add the following into your ssh config and pre-poplulate settings.
That would cause any ssh connection matching node* to use the user staffuser and .ssh/staff_key as the ssh key. By the same token you could do this.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p><p>I have a pretty good memory when it comes to juggling multiple tasks but I am (and have been for some time) trying to break my self of using my brain to store everything. One area a worklog benefits is when you want to look back over time and see what your were working on several months ago (this can be helpful for reviews). At any rate there are many tools to do similar things. At any rate I wrote a simple tool to try and help with this. Feel free to take it modify it or comment on the horrible code.</p></p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Some projects have production code that runs off of a git cloned repository. There may be a case in which you want to notify others when that clone pulls. It is a pretty easy feat with gits post-merge hook. The post-merge hook will run after a merge (think git pull). All you have to do it create a project/.git/hooks/post-merge shell script and chmod +x it. Next time you pull successfully that script will run.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I see Samuel Huckinsjust had a post about apachetop http://dancingpenguinsoflight.com/2008/12/top-for-apache-activity/ which I have been meaning to mention for a while, but being that there is a fresh post about it I will mention Mytop instead.
Mytop is top for mysql. It can be used for monitoring the threads and overall performance of a MySQL.
Its an easy install in debain with a quick aptitude install mytop.
Here is some example output (sorry my mysql server isnt very busy atm).</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I was recently asked how to change screens working directory. It took me a few minutes to realize the benefit of this as I typically have different screen sessions for different purposes. But after thinking about it for a few minutes I have been in situations where what I was doing in a screen session morphed and it would have been nice for new windows to be opened to a different working directory than where I started my session.</p></div>

Handy shell function you can put in your .bashrc. Quickly find out what server a host is running.
Now try what-http-server kernel.org google.com hotmail.com.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>For those of you who are horrid at math like I am googles unit conversion is a great help. Want to know how many GB 1Mbps is in a month? Simple just ask google. Well I like to have the ability even when I am not online and I found units. Its in the debian repository and oh so easy to use.
