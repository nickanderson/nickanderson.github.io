				<h4 class="post-date">2012-10-18</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>CFEngine defines a classes for decision making during runs. Many of these hard classes you can see by running cf-promises -v. That wont show you all the other classes that are raised during a policy run.
You could run something like this to see what classes are raised during execution.
cf-agent -KIv | grep "cf3&gt;\s*+" | grep -v : But that isn’t really a clear picture under normal operation. You can use the allclassesreport in body agent control to write out a list of classes defined during execution in /var/cfengine/state/allclasses.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Methods type promises are powerful abstraction tools in CFEngine 3. Methods allow you to activate bundles (optionally parametrized) from other bundles. This allows encapsulation of knowledge and lends itself to re-usability.
I just want to share an example of calling bundles dynamically. It’s a contrived example, but I thought it was neat so here it is.
R: in bundle agent handler1: I got value1  R: in bundle agent handler1: I got value2  &nbsp;!</p></div>

Special thanks to CFEngine for sponsering me!

				<h4 class="post-date">2012-07-17</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I was inspired by William Orr’s svn commit hook and looked up the magic needed to flesh out the git pre-commit hook I submitted to the Design Center a while back.
Now the index is checked out to its own temporary directory and cf-promises validates promises.cf and failsafe.cf before allowing the commit to proceed. Now you won’t get syntax errors if you have forgotten to add a new policy file to the index but its already included in your body common control inputs list.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2012-07-14</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I updated the CFEngine 3 by example vagrant project so that /var/cfengine/masterfiles is a git clone (kept in sync with VCS::vcs_mirror) of the generated bare repository from the seed files. I found during a presentation that it would just be easier to have everyone start of with the typical workflow instead of going through the process of getting there. I hope it makes it easier for people to get a working test env up in a few minutes.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I liked this, so I thought I would share. Found on the inter-webs.
Something that is complex can be broken down into simple parts, without being simple itself. This allows mostly smooth functioning with solvable problems.
Something that is complicated cannot be broken down into simple parts, for it is made of complicated parts. “Complicated” is indicative of something that is problematic, convoluted, difficult and inconsistent.
The difference can be made by imagining a piece of string tied to be a circle.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>If you follow CFEngine you may have notices that the multiple pay versions have been condensed down to CFEngine Enterprise with the latest release. You may not have noticed that the CFEngine Design Center also launched.
Don’t get me wrong, I am excited about the new 25 free enterprise nodes and the new features in the Enterprise edition, but I see greater value in the Design Center. This is a great resource for new and old users.</p></div>

			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I just finished reading the final release of Diego Zambonis’ Learning CFEngine 3. I can’t recommend this book enough. If your just learning CFEngine 3, if you are versed but not an expert and you like CFEngine you will like this book. If you meet all those criteria and you don’t like the book, I’ll buy you a beer if we ever meet. It’s well worth the 20 dollars, or 14 if you want the ebook (DRM FREE!</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2012-03-29</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I have been using bibble for about a year now. Its the best photo editing software that ran on linux that I could find. It probably isn’t as polished as Photoshop but it has its own great features like threading so it can use all of your cores for rendering.
Just over a week ago I noticed it had been bought by Corel and its been re-branded to AfterShotPro. I really hope they continue to develop it and provide Linux support.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Here is an easy way to configure encfs with dropbox that is compatible with boxcryptor. Boxcryptor makes Windows, Mac Android, and IOS applications to assist you in accessing data that you have stored in encfs. They do require that you create your encfs with some specific options: Cipher algorithm: AES, Plaintext or Stream encrypted filenames, No filename initialization vector chaining, No per-file initialization vectors, No external IV chaining, No block MAC headers, No per-block random bytes.</p></div>
