						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Python has become my language of choice for automation and general scripting. Its nice to have an editor that makes things easier when your doing things. Its also nice to use an editor that you can find just about anywhere. I have customized my vim to make doing things in python much quicker and this is an old post where I talk about some of the modifications.

						<div class="post-summary"><p>This is just an old entry that I thought was interesting, and it appears its still relevant. Like a broken record, &#8220;economic times are rough&#8221;, what better way to boost your revenue than to exploit your customers. What better way to suppress a competitor than to increase a competitors infrastructure costs (with little visibility to boot). I did some repeated lookups this morning and got similar results.

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Another day, another flashback. I don&#8217;t know about you but at times I have had some very odd and uncomfortable requests from vendors. It&#8217;s not wholly uncommon for them to want to log into your system to diagnose an issue for themselves. Or perhaps for whatever reason your manager says hey give this random outside person access to some important box. As a SA you get used to extremely odd requests and figure out how to just solve the problem.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Matt Simmons is trying to dust off some old articles he think some people may have missed. So I figure why not. A while back I talked about how to move a website (read DNS sucks , you need a reverse proxy). In fact I have talked about reverse proxies a few times since I tend to find them so useful. At any rate, this article stemmed from the first hand experience that opened my eyes to how bad DNS infrastructure really was.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>The last few days I have been having a pretty good debate with a friend about the virtues of open source vs Appliances. At times its gotten pretty heated but its all in good fun. The current debate centers around email infrastructure. There are options on the table to use an appliance, or a 3rd party service to control the spam. Of course I was appalled that SpamAssassin and brethren were not on the table.</p></p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Ewwww, scary isn&#8217;t it. No Its not Halloween, but you may have entered the twilight zone. Right, I never touch Microsoft products. Well in actuality sometimes I do (I just don&#8217;t brag about it). Some of the development at $work uses Microsofts Mediaroom, and I have a &#8220;Personal Server&#8221; (great name right?) that the developers use. I was trying to install the Mediaroom service pack yesterday and took some notes on the process. Some of my friends found it quite entertaining. I found it quite aggravating﻿ as you might imagine.</p></p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Many of you know that I had a son about 6 months ago now. What you may not know is that my wife decided to quit her job and start a home daycare so she could be at home with our son. We all know how hard kids can be on DVDs and the like, so its important to be able to back them up. I am not a fan of the encryption or the new copy protections that have been put in place (ARccOS, RipGuard).</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Gah so I was futzing with the acl map on our subversion server. Organizing things into groups. I wasn&#8217;t thinking and started uppercasing the users ids when moving them into groups (yes i hate uppercase but its easy to highlight paste them). This of course stopped authentication from working for people who have cached auths returning a 403 error. So how to quickly lowercase a huge swath of ids?</p></p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>I am sure you are aware of my affinity for the Xen hypervisor. In the last year I have switched over to Citrix Xenserver. With other people managing VMs as well having a nice GUI is helpful. One of my complaints is that the GUI (XenCenter) is a windows only app. C&#8217;mon, Citrix, please release a cross platform management console. I&#8217;ve got to run a windows VM just to use the GUI (granted I don&#8217;t have to use the gui, there is a nice API and console utilities). At any rate today I noticed that I could no longer pull up the console for a windows VM nor could I pull up the performance metrics available in XenCenter. A few searches turned up <a href="http://kennethhunt.com">Kenneth Hunts blog</a> and a post that showed me where to fix it.</p></p></div>
