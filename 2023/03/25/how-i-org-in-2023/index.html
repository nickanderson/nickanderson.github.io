<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Unrealistically I want total recall, to remember everything in durable plain text. I want to have control of my data. I want to do my work and interact efficiently. I want to improve my knowledge and capabilities and I want to be able to share with others.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-statistics">High level statistics</h2>
<p>As of <code>Friday, December 15, 2023</code> I had <code>56MB</code> of <code>.org</code> files in <code>~/org</code>. That&rsquo;s  <code>4889</code> files and <code>1186734</code> lines of text, the largest single file was <code>1.3M</code> and the longest lined file was <code>26370</code> lines.</p>
<p><code>4716</code> of these files were inside org-roam, the majority of them (<code>3558</code>) were &ldquo;dailies&rdquo; or time-series files.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I had some <code>27MB</code> other older <code>.org</code> files outside <code>~/org</code> that aren&rsquo;t even included in those stats. The largest of those files  was <code>5.6M</code>, and the longest lined file had <code>81921</code> lines. At couple centuries ago glacial speed (I guess they are moving pretty quickly these days) I refiled things from there into <code>~/org</code>. Not to mention <code>~/Syncthing/Orgzly</code> with <code>7.9MB</code> worth of <code>.org</code> files that I synced around to a few devices and the largest <code>.org</code> file was <code>677K</code> with the most lined file having <code>49670</code> lines.</p>

<h2 id="system">System</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really use any existing workflow or organization methodology like PARA, CODE, ACCESS, Johnny Decimal, etc &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know that I am organized (or disciplined?) enough to follow some thing like that. I appreciate them and pick up ideas reading about methodologies that work for others.</p>
<p>I use the Nick Anderson S.H.I.T. (Stuff here &rsquo;n there) methodology.</p>

<p>I capture as much as I reasonably can. When I see enough of the same type of things I try to pile them near each other and build some kind of pneumatic tube to automatically funnel similar things into the right pile automatically.</p>

<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>
<p>Capturing is an important concept. Fundamentally it&rsquo;s grabbing new content and putting it somewhere. It facilitates consistency and automates some tedium. It&rsquo;s something that should be fast and not interrupt my flow.</p>
<p><code>org-roam</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is my primary capture interface and I <em>really</em> like the daily capabilities. Each day I capture notes about everything I am working on into my work log while clocking time. This gives me a nice place to think and process what I am working on<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> as well as a place to get my bearings and see what I had been working on when I got side-tracked<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Having a new file each day gave me a fresh start and it helped me to avoid performance issues I had previously experienced with large (multi-megabyte) files. I still had a lot of org files not under my roam directory which I had yet to (and may never fully) migrate.</p>
<p>I had <code>24</code> org-capture-templates,  <code>16</code> org-roam-capture-templates and <code>75</code> org-roam-dailies-capture-templates.</p>

<p>Beyond my time-series notes I had other collections of related notes in sub directories. For example, I had many notes about CFEngine (the best configuration management tool)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. I kept my CFEngine related notes in <code>~/org/roam/CFEngine</code> with sub directories for different things ( blogs, examples, index.org, northern.tech-customers, notes, opportunities,
).</p>
<p>I used <code>org-web-tools</code> to pull web pages into org. Either as a buffer to read, or as a subtree to store.</p>
<p><code>org-rich-yank</code><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> let me copy text and paste it with context allowing it to be syntax highlighted as well as providing a link back to the source.</p>
<h2 id="retrieval">Retrieval</h2>
<p>When I am retrieving information from my system I am usually searching for a note by name or searching for what notes I have about something.</p>
<p>When searching for a note by name, I&rsquo;ll use <code>org-roam-node-find</code>.</p>
<p>When I am searching wide I use <code>ripgrep</code> via <code>consult-ripgrep</code> which is bound to <code>SPC /</code> and searches <code>~/org</code> by default.</p>
<p>If I have found a note I can see what other notes link to it with <code>org-roam-buffer</code>. There is even support for finding <em>unlinked</em> back references, which I am not using for performance reasons.</p>
<figure><img src="org-roam-buffer.png"/>
</figure>

<p><code>org-roam-ui</code> provides a really fun interactive 2 or 3d graph showing the links between nodes allowing you to explore your notes visually.</p>

<p><code>org-roam-random-note</code> can be fun to stumble around completely random nodes. There exists a video on YouTube but I&rsquo;m currently unable to find the reference where someone customizes their startup to display a random note.</p>
<p><code>org-agenda</code> can be fed by <code>org-roam-db-query</code>, helping to solve the issue of figuring out which files should be included by agenda. I have done this, but I still don&rsquo;t really make use of <code>org-agenda</code>, I want to, but it hasn&rsquo;t clicked for me yet so I just keep poking at it a few times a year.</p>
<p>org-roam-dynamic-blocks is neat for maintaining a list of notes matching some criteria from org-roam though I don&rsquo;t make use of this near as much as I would like yet.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Output is an important aspect of my system. It&rsquo;s important to me that I can easily share my knowledge with others.</p>
<p>I use org-babel frequently. It&rsquo;s very convenient and efficient to be able to execute code directly in my documents.
Copying and pasting between a console and what I am writing introduces much chance for error. Having code blocks and in-line execution improve the accuracy of my notes and anything else that I am producing.</p>
<p>For example, the Statistics section of this post uses inline code blocks and the data is freshly generated each time I export an updated version. Named blocks let me inject dynamic content in a sentence and provides easy access for on-demand execution, not to mention the ability to leverage as input to other blocks.</p>
<p>I have begun to make more consistent use of <code>org-transclusion</code><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> while authoring content. Instead of duplicating content copying to the new place I want to use it I will distill what I want to use into an atomic chunk and then reference it. I find this is helpful in several ways. It reduces unnecessary growth to the volume of text that I have, reduces the number of duplicate hits for things when I am searching for something, increases the interlinking of my org-mode files providing a more rich experience with <code>org-roam-buffer</code> showing things that used the content as well as interconnected in the <code>org-roam-ui</code> graph visualization.</p>
<p>With so many export backends available I don&rsquo;t usually have to spend time mucking around with some bespoke syntax. I can author in org-mode and quickly export it to another format. It&rsquo;s nice to have relatively good formatting in many formats with relatively little effort.</p>
<p>I export using <code>ox-jira</code> and use <code>org-jira</code> to manage issues in Jira Cloud. Again, everyone benefits from well styled comments and ticket descriptions and no real extra effort is required from me.</p>
<p>I make presentations using <code>org-reveal</code> and <code>org-re-reveal</code> with nice features like speaker notes. These presentations can also be printed to PDF.</p>
<p>I write reports that I export to ODT for copying and pasting into google drive<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and PDF for emailing to clients.</p>
<p>I write blog posts exporting with <code>ox-hugo</code> to multiple websites using different hugo configurations.</p>
<p>I author emails in org-mode exported with <code>org-mime</code><sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> as a multi-part ASCII &amp; HTML message.</p>
<p><code>abbrev-mode</code> is amazing at auto correcting my most common typos. <code>writegood-mode</code> and <code>olivette</code> are both nice for writing.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>So, how does a day in my org life flow?</p>
<p>Usually my day starts with meetings. I like to take notes and email them to a distribution list afterwords<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. For example, a few minutes before my CFEngine stand-up I run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-today</code> and key in <code>w</code> (work) <code>m</code> (meeting) <code>c</code> (CFEngine) <code>d</code> (daily stand-up). Immediately after activating this capture I trigger another capture for my work log keying in <code>w</code> (work) <code>l</code> (log)<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> which clocks time.</p>
<figure><img src="standup-worklog.gif"
         alt="Figure 9: Animation showing standup and worklog capture" width="100%"/><figcaption>
            <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 9: </span>Animation showing standup and worklog capture</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The work log capture template includes a backlink to the stand-up note for the day, so I follow that link and start going through my template filling it out. The template has a headline for each person with a property that links to a node for the individual. My own section contains a clock table which quickly produces a nice list of the entries with clocked time from the previous day (on Mondays or days when I have missed prior N days I tweak the clock table to pull for the right number of previous days). I review the table to see how good I was about clocking the previous day back-filling anything that I neglected to record then delete time columns.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting I use <code>org-mime</code><sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> to prepare a nicely formatted multipart ASCII &amp; HTML email. After sending the mail I switch back to my work log capture and complete it. All of my regularly scheduled meetings follow the same process; I capture for the meeting template, then I capture to my work log clocking time with an automatic backlink back to the specific meeting note. It&rsquo;s easy to capture notes for yesterday, tomorrow or an arbitrary date in the future using <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday</code>, <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow</code>, and <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-date</code>.</p>
<p>Org-roam provides useful functions for accessing time-series notes. <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-today</code> will take you to today&rsquo;s note for the selected template and if the file does not exist it is initialized. Similarly <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday</code>, <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow</code>, and <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-date</code> take you to the note for yesterday, tomorrow, or the specified date, creating the file if necessary. <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-previous</code> and <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-next</code> go to the previous and next note in the series based on the file you are currently visiting making for easy navigation through the time series.</p>
<p><code>org-roam-node-random</code> is fun, as it says, it takes you to a random node. It&rsquo;s nice for serendipitous stumbles.</p>
<p>If I am working on something that has some regular pattern but is not a recurring time series I follow a similar pattern, but instead of <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> I run <code>org-roam-capture</code>. Unlike <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> <code>org-roam-capture</code> first prompts for a node title and you select a template afterwords. For example, if I am working on support case I will run <code>org-roam-capture</code>, enter the issue number and then key in <code>w</code> (work) <code>s</code> (support). I am taken to a new node in the file for that support case where I immediately trigger <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> for my work log which starts clocking time and I follow the link back to the node to continue my work.</p>
<p>For other activities that are typically fast or aren&rsquo;t of a common type spanning multiple days I simply run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> and keep notes directly in my work log.</p>
<p>I author pretty much everything in <code>org-mode</code>. I am often able to stay in inside <code>org-mode</code> and keep a very thorough record of my exact activities. When I need to run commands I typically use <code>org-babel</code> so that commands their output and my thoughts about it form a nice log of my work as I proceed. This log is often directly transferable to communicate with others for which I leverage the copious export back ends available<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As of Friday, December 15, 2023
I currently have  <code>15189</code> nodes across <code>4716</code> files in org-roam.</p>
<h3 id="contrived-example">Contrived example</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through a contrived example.</p>
<p>While checking my email in <code>mu4e</code><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> and see a message from the CFEngine help list asking how to define a <em>class</em> from a <em>variable</em>. The author shared what they had tried but it wasn&rsquo;t working. I want to respond to it so I run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> and key in <code>e</code> (email) <code>r</code> (response). This creates a new node in today&rsquo;s work log with the headline <code>Responded to cfengineer@some.org Re: How do I define a class from a variable?</code> and a link back to the message in <code>mu4e</code> (that information was automatically pulled directly from the email I was reading when I initiated the capture).</p>
<p>This is the capture template I use for email responses. It populates the necessary property for proper threading (message-id).</p>

I use YAsnippet<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> to insert a cfengine src block. I re-use or write a new example running the block as I go to make sure it does what I expected until I am satisfied. Once finished I run <code>org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize</code> which exports the <code>org-mode</code> formatted text to a multipart plain text (ascii) and html message. Then I <code>C-c</code> to send it off and again to complete my capture. At this point I will probably run <code>org-roam-capture</code> type the name of the example, e.g. <code>class defined from variable</code> and key in <code>c</code> (CFEngine) <code>e</code> (Example). In the example I use <code>org-roam-node-insert</code> to create links to each function that is used in the example. This helps future me find all the examples that use a specific function from that functions note.</p>
<p>Next I decide that documentation should to be updated, so I run <code>org-jira-create-issue</code>, fill out the necessary minimal information and once the ticket has been created I run <code>org-jira-progress-issue</code> to set it in progress and I initiate a new work log capture. I run <code>projectile-switch-project</code> and switch to the documentation repository. I find the documentation I want to update and yank it. Then I head back to my work log run <code>org-rich-yank</code> to paste the copied text with a link back to where I got it and type something about how it sucks. As I explain why it sucks I visit other repositories yanking other snippets of code for reference to backup my assertion. <code>ol-git-link</code> provides some nice capabilities for linking to git forges which is very helpful for others as well as future me doing archaeology.</p>
<p>When updating the Jira ticket I export the notes I took to Jira wiki syntax with <code>ox-jira</code> <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. I copy that exported text, and then add it to the Jira ticket using <code>org-jira-add-comment</code>. Before I start updating the documentation I create a new branch with <code>magit-branch-create</code><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. I make the changes I want, commit and push. Forge<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> let&rsquo;s me proceed to open a pull request, request reviewers, make comments and easily grab the URL of the Pull Request which gets added to my work log which ultimately becomes a well styled comment in the associated Jira issue. Once the PR is approved I merge the pull request with <code>forge-merge</code> and close the issue with <code>org-jira-progress-issue</code>. Notice that I never left Emacs and my work log functioned as my home base where the notes I took became part of the work I produced in the form of a well styled Jira comment.
I make presentations in org mode, for example <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnickanderson%2FOrg-mode-all-the-thingz%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fpresentation.html">Org-mode all the thingz!</a> which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE4eGkIQycc">I gave at Kansas Linux Fest in 2019</a><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As you can probably see I make heavy use of org-mode&rsquo;s exporting capabilities. In addition to the above mentioned use cases I also export to ODT, PDF, mediawiki, Slack, Hugo and various other flavors of Markdown.</p>
<p>I (very infrequently) make diagrams with PlantUML<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. I might try Mermaid<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> next time.</p>
<p>I keep secrets in org-mode. The contents of headings that have the crypt tag are automatically GPG encrypted to my GPG key on save.</p>
<p>While I started my journey with org-mode using agenda for GTD and managing tasks, I have yet to master it or really even manage to get it to stick in my workflow but I keep trying. I recently got agenda feeding from a list of files based on <code>org-roam-db-query</code> <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  This way I can have TODOs all over the place but I can keep agenda fast by keeping the number of files it considers relatively small.</p>
<p>I keep notes on people. My x-files or rolodex consists of one note per person<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I use <code>org-web-tools</code> to archive pull copies of web pages into notes so that I have references even when the internet breaks. I take a lot of screenshots while doing things and I pull them into my documents with org-download<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When working on long documents I sometimes turn on <code>olivetti-mode</code><sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. And I am starting to like org-sticky-header<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I use various things for searching across my org files. When searching for text I use <code>ripgrep</code> <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> , in Spacemacs it&rsquo;s bound to <code>SPC /</code> and you are prompted to choose a top level directory to start your search from. Several years back I used Deft<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> for a while but found that it really didn&rsquo;t suite me well and it simply doesn&rsquo;t perform well<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> for my volume of files. I still have a bunch of files in my deft directory that should probably just move into my roam.</p>
<p>The default display when using <code>org-roam-node-find</code> shows only node names, I find a hierarchy much more useful. I adjusted it to show the node hierarchy using the example shown in the User contributed tricks<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. E.g. File title -&gt; heading 1 -&gt; Heading 2 -&gt; &hellip;</p>

</div><h3 id="mobile">Mobile</h3>
<p>Going mobile with <code>org-mode</code> I use several different applications to help.</p>
<p>I use Syncthing to syncrhonize files across devices. I only synchronize a subset of my org files to mobile devices. I don&rsquo;t really need the ability to access my whole exocortex on the go.</p>
<p>Orgzly is my primary capture tool on mobile. My <code>Orgzly</code> directory is synchronized across all of my mobile devices. Each device that I use Orgzly on has a device specific file that is configured as the <code>Default notebook</code>.  I really like the home screen widget, I typically have it showing a query showing notes from the device specific file created in the last 3 days. If I want to take a note I use the <code>+</code> button on the home screen widget, there is also an option for a new note in the notifications drop-down drawer but I tend not to use that. It&rsquo;s pretty serviceable for short notes about something, e.g. &ldquo;Saw Brian at the store, he broke his foot. We should get together and grill.&rdquo; or lists for the store e.g. &ldquo;TODO Milk :@store:&rdquo;, &ldquo;TODO Black Beans :@store:&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It makes it easy for managing trips to the store. But the editing experience is lacking, and I am in great wish of an improved capture capabilities. It can&rsquo;t deal with a deep directory structure of files and while that isn&rsquo;t much of an issue for me, it would be a great capability and I do miss it. I had some issues with sync conflicts that lead me to introduce a Tasker automation to synchronize the Orgzly db on screen wake<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. I also make a practice of having one capture file per mobile device. I haven&rsquo;t had many sync conflicts since implementing those things. I re-file my Orgzly captures to my main system way less often than I should. They usually go to my personal journal, someday I hope to have some function to refile to a specific org-roam-dailies-capture template for date at point<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other applications that I use on mobile that deserve mention:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Logseq</dt>
<dd>I really like how daily file are featured. I miss a capture capability. I dislike how the share to target is not stable. It shares to the insertion point. So if the app is open in the background that share might go to some random place I stopped writing. It&rsquo;s convenient at times, other times very inconvenient. I don&rsquo;t love the editing interface. Everything is a headline, so it&rsquo;s a bit ugly when I come to the file in Emacs, but It&rsquo;s what I tend to use if I am writing something longer on mobile, for example that is where I drafted many points for this blog post over the course of a couple months re-visiting it from time to time before I pulled it in to my system for authoring this post.</dd>
<dt>Metanote</dt>
<dd>I don&rsquo;t see other people mention this one. I have found it to be a bit slow but the editing UI is not bad. Also, it has a few capture templates as well as Agenda.</dd>
<dt>Orgro</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s read only, so it&rsquo;s of limited use given my current sync patterns but it&rsquo;s good for that.</dd>

<h3 id="llms">LLMs</h3>
<p>2023 was a banner year for generative AI and like many others I dabbled to see how my workflow could benefit from the use of large language models. While OpenAI was all the rage, I was mostly interested in local LLMs.</p>
<h4 id="org-ai">org-ai</h4>
<p>In June I started to use <code>org-ai</code><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> for a bit but it required emacs 28.2 which I don&rsquo;t run regularly and additionally the way it used blocks felt a bit un-natural.</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</h4>
<p>In July 5th 2023 I began using <code>chatpt-shell</code><sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> for dall-e and chatgpt. But given my aversion to using hosted services I didn&rsquo;t use it often.</p>
<p>You can use the shell conversationally with chatgpt or dall-e.</p>
<figure><img src="asking-dall-e-to-make-image-in-dall-e-shell.png"
         alt="Figure 10: Asking Dall-e to make an image using the interactive dall-e-shell" width="50%"/><figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most often I use babel src blocks but I seem to lose context history with that so I tend to re-feed my entire query. I&rsquo;ve used it to help me re-word text, brainstorm creative ideas, and generate shell one-liners, all from the comfort of my Emacs org-mode buffer.</p>

<p>By August 13th I had started to play with Khoj<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s neat, but was terribly slow with the local model. By October 17th Khoj had added support for GPU offload and the speed of the local LLM responses improved greatly. Around this time the developers got quite busy with larger re-architectures and running Khoj locally was not working well and sadly my use decreased. It&rsquo;s really nice that the developers actually use org-mode themselves and there is support from within Emacs.</p>

</div><p>Looking forward to 2024 where I hope to see the self hosting and general usability improve.</p>
<p>Specifically I hope to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to the Emacs client so that it does not block Emacs waiting on llm inference (search has been lightning fast).</li>
<li>Easy self hosting out of the box with GPU offload support.</li>
<li>Improved RAG, leveraging my notes is amazing, but my notes mish-mash of structuring don&rsquo;t seem to work well.</li>
<li>Easier swapping of local models. Maybe even via Ollma</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gptel">gptel</h4>
<p>By the end of October I started using <code>gptel</code> <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Initially I used it with GPT4All Desktop but quickly found ollma which made it very easy to try different models as well as running queries from the CLI. gptel has such a light weight interface, it became my primary llm interface. Wherever I am, I can easily select some text and ship it off to the llm of my choice with a prompt.</p>
<p>It would be really neat if support for Khoj was added so that I could easily ask questions about my notes. <code>gptel</code> doesn&rsquo;t block waiting for LLMs to respond like the Khoj package did.</p>
<p>The author is quite responsive, great package, 10/10 recommend.</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel</h2>
<p>Typically I am a function over form kind of person, but I do use a few thing that improve the look of my Emacs for <code>org-mode</code>.</p>
<p>I think <code>org-modern</code> makes things look a bit nicer. With <code>org-modern</code> and <code>org-indent</code> enabled the fringe around src blocks is disabled. I used <code>org-modern-indent</code> to fix that up.</p>
