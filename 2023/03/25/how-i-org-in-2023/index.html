It&rsquo;s my exocortex, second brain, and personal knowledge management system. The features and tools I use as well as how I organize my files has changed quite a bit over this period of time and I thought it would be nice give myself (and anyone else who cares) a reference of what it was like in 2023 so here it is.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-statistics">High level statistics</h2>
<p>As of Sunday, June 11, 2023
I have <code>48M</code> of <code>.org</code> files in <code>~/org</code>. That&rsquo;s  <code>4178</code> files, the largest single file is <code>1.3M</code> and the longest lined file has <code>21639</code> lines.</p>
<p><code>4001</code> of these files are inside org-roam, the majority of them (<code>3028</code>) are &ldquo;dailies&rdquo; or time-series files.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I have <code>24</code> org-capture-templates,  <code>16</code> org-roam-capture-templates and <code>68</code> org-roam-dailies-capture-templates.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>
<p>Capturing is an important concept. Fundamentally it&rsquo;s grabbing new content and putting it somewhere. It facilitates consistency and automates some tedium. It&rsquo;s something that should be fast and not interrupt my flow.</p>
<p>As you may have been able to tell <code>org-roam</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is my primary capture interface and I <em>really</em> like the daily capabilities. Each day I capture notes about everything I am working on into my work log while clocking time. This gives me a nice place to think and process what I am working on<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as well as a place to get my bearings and see what I have been working on when I get side-tracked<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Having a new file each day gives me a fresh start and it helps me to avoid performance issues I have previously experienced with large (multi-megabyte) files. I still have a lot of org files not under my roam directory which I have yet (and may never fully) to migrate.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Beyond my time-series notes I have other collections of related notes in sub directories. For example, I have many notes about CFEngine (the best configuration management tool)<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. I keep my CFEngine related notes in <code>~/org/roam/CFEngine</code> with sub directories for different things ( blogs, examples, index.org, northern.tech-customers, notes, opportunities,
).</p>
<h2 id="retrieval">Retrieval</h2>
<p>When I am retrieving information from my system I am usually searching for a note by name or searching to what notes I have about something.</p>
<p>When searching for a note by name, Ill use <code>org-roam-node-find</code>.</p>
<p>When I am searching wide ill use <code>ripgrep</code> via <code>consult-ripgrep</code> which is bound to <code>SPC /</code> and searches <code>~/org</code> by default.</p>
<p>If I have found a note I can see what other notes link to it with <code>org-roam-buffer</code>. There is even support for finding <em>unlinked</em> back references, which I am not using for performance reasons.</p>
<p><code>org-roam-ui</code> provides a really fun interactive 2 or 3d graph showing the links between nodes.</p>

<p>agenda can be fed by org-roam-db-query, helping to solve the issue of figuring out which files should be included by agenda.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Output is an important aspect of my system. It&rsquo;s important to me that I can easily share my knowledge with others.</p>
<p>With so many export backends available I don&rsquo;t usually have to spend time mucking around with some bespoke syntax. I can author in org-mode and quickly export it to another format. It&rsquo;s nice to have relatively good formatting in many formats with relatively little effort.</p>
<p>I use ox-jira and org-jira to manage issues in Jira Cloud.</p>
<p>I make presentations using org-reveal.</p>
<p>I write reports that I export to odt for copying and pasting into google drive<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and pdf for emailing to clients.</p>
<p>I write blog posts exporting with ox-hugo to multiple websites using different hugo configurations.</p>
<p>I author emails in org-mode.</p>
<p>I re-use existing content interleaving it without duplication.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>So, how does a day in my org life flow?</p>
<p>Usually my day starts with meetings. I like to take notes and email them to a distribution list afterwords<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. For example, a few minutes before my CFEngine stand-up I run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-today</code> and key in <code>w</code> (work) <code>m</code> (meeting) <code>c</code> (CFEngine) <code>d</code> (daily stand-up). Immediately after activating this capture I trigger another capture for my work log keying in <code>w</code> (work) <code>l</code> (log)<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> which clocks time.</p>
<figure><img src="standup-worklog.gif"
         alt="Figure 5: Animation showing standup and worklog capture" width="100%"/><figcaption>
            <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figure 5: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Animation showing standup and worklog capture</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The work log capture template includes a backlink to the stand-up note for the day, so I follow that link and start going through my template filling it out. The template has a headline for each person with a property that links to a node for the individual. My own section contains a clock table which quickly produces a nice list of the entries with clocked time from the previous day (on Mondays or days when I have missed prior N days I tweak the clock table to pull for the right number of previous days). I review the table to see how good I was about clocking the previous day back-filling anything that I neglected to record then delete time columns.</p>
<p>#+comment Animation of standup clock table in action <img src="./attachments/how-i-org-in-2023/standup-my-clocktable.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>At the end of the meeting I use <code>org-mime</code><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> to prepare a nicely formatted multipart ASCII &amp; HTML email. After sending the mail I switch back to my work log capture and complete it. All of my regularly scheduled meetings follow the same process; I capture for the meeting template, then I capture to my work log clocking time with an automatic backlink back to the specific meeting note. It&rsquo;s easy to capture notes for yesterday, tomorrow or an arbitrary date in the future using <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday</code>, <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow</code>, and <code>org-roam-dailies-capture-date</code>.</p>
<p>Org-roam provides useful functions for accessing time-series notes. <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-today</code> will take you to today&rsquo;s note for the selected template and if the file does not exist it is initialized. Similarly <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday</code>, <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow</code>, and <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-date</code> take you to the note for yesterday, tomorrow, or the specified date, creating the file if necessary. <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-previous</code> and <code>org-roam-dailies-goto-next</code> go to the previous and next note in the series based on the file you are currently visiting making for easy navigation through the time series.</p>
<p><code>org-roam-node-random</code> is fun, as it says, it takes you to a random node. It&rsquo;s nice for serendipitous stumbles.</p>
<p>If I am working on something that has some regular pattern but is not a recurring time series I follow a similar pattern, but instead of <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> I run <code>org-roam-capture</code>. Unlike <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> <code>org-roam-capture</code> first prompts for a node title and you select a template afterwords. For example, if I am working on support case I will run <code>org-roam-capture</code>, enter the issue number and then key in <code>w</code> (work) <code>s</code> (support). I am taken to a new node in the file for that support case where I immediately trigger <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> for my work log which starts clocking time and I follow the link back to the node to continue my work.</p>
<p>For other activities that are typically fast or aren&rsquo;t of a common type spanning multiple days I simply run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> and keep notes directly in my work log.</p>
<p>I author pretty much everything in <code>org-mode</code>. I am often able to stay in inside <code>org-mode</code> and keep a very thorough record of my exact activities. When I need to run commands I typically use <code>org-babel</code> so that commands their output and my thoughts about it form a nice log of my work as I proceed. This log is often directly transferable to communicate with others for which I leverage the copious export back ends available<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, June 11, 2023
I currently have  <code>13130</code> nodes across <code>4001</code> files in org-roam.</p>
<p>I use inline code blocks while authoring this post to get current numbers on export. The above text looks like this in my org-mode file for the post which I export with <code>ox-hugo</code>.</p>

</div><h3 id="contrived-example">Contrived example</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through a contrived example.</p>
<p>While checking my email in <code>mu4e</code><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> and see a message from the CFEngine help list asking how to define a <em>class</em> from a <em>variable</em>. The author shared what they had tried but it wasn&rsquo;t working. I want to respond to it so I run <code>org-roam-dailies-capture</code> and key in <code>e</code> (email) <code>r</code> (response). This creates a new node in today&rsquo;s work log with the headline <code>Responded to cfengineer@some.org Re: How do I define a class from a variable?</code> and a link back to the message in <code>mu4e</code> (that information was automatically pulled directly from the email I was reading when I initiated the capture).</p>
<p>This is the capture template I use for email responses. It populates the necessary property for proper threading (message-id).</p>

</div>
</div><p>I start typing my response and use <code>org-roam-node-find</code>  to search for pre-existing examples leveraging any functions I want to use linking to them from my note. I use YAsnippet<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> to insert a cfengine src block. I re-use or write a new example running the block as I go to make sure it does what I expected until I am satisfied. Once finished I run <code>org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize</code> which exports the <code>org-mode</code> formatted text to a multipart plain text (ascii) and html message. Then I <code>C-c</code> to send it off and again to complete my capture. At this point I will probably run <code>org-roam-capture</code> type the name of the example, e.g. <code>class defined from variable</code> and key in <code>c</code> (CFEngine) <code>e</code> (Example). In the example I use <code>org-roam-node-insert</code> to create links to each function that is used in the example. This helps future me find all the examples that use a specific function from that functions note.</p>
<p>Next I decide that documentation should to be updated, so I run <code>org-jira-create-issue</code>, fill out the necessary minimal information and once the ticket has been created I run <code>org-jira-progress-issue</code> to set it in progress and I initiate a new work log capture. I run <code>projectile-switch-project</code> and switch to the documentation repository. I find the documentation I want to update and yank it. Then I head back to my work log run <code>org-rich-yank</code><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> to paste the copied text with a link back to where I got it and type something about how it sucks. As I explain why it sucks I visit other repositories yanking other snippets of code for reference to backup my assertion. <code>ol-git-link</code> provides some nice capabilities for linking to git forges which is very helpful for others as well as future me doing archaeology.</p>
<p>When updating the Jira ticket I export the notes I took to Jira wiki syntax with <code>ox-jira</code> <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. I copy that exported text, and then add it to the Jira ticket using <code>org-jira-add-comment</code>. Before I start updating the documentation I create a new branch with <code>magit-branch-create</code><sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. I make the changes I want, commit and push. Forge<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> let&rsquo;s me proceed to open a pull request, request reviewers, make comments and easily grab the URL of the Pull Request which gets added to my work log which ultimately becomes a well styled comment in the associated Jira issue. Once the PR is approved I merge the pull request with <code>forge-merge</code> and close the issue with <code>org-jira-progress-issue</code>. Notice that I never left Emacs and my work log functioned as my home base where the notes I took became part of the work I produced in the form of a well styled Jira comment.
I make presentations in org mode, for example <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnickanderson%2FOrg-mode-all-the-thingz%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fpresentation.html">Org-mode all the thingz!</a> which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE4eGkIQycc">I gave at Kansas Linux Fest in 2019</a><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As you can probably see I make heavy use of org-mode&rsquo;s exporting capabilities. In addition to the above mentioned use cases I also export to ODT, PDF, mediawiki, Slack, Hugo and various other flavors of Markdown.</p>
<p>I (very infrequently) make diagrams with PlantUML<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. I might try Mermaid<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> next time.</p>
<p>I keep secrets in org-mode. The contents of headings that have the crypt tag are automatically GPG encrypted to my GPG key on save.</p>
<p>While I started my journey with org-mode using agenda for GTD and managing tasks, I have yet to master it or really even manage to get it to stick in my workflow but I keep trying. I recently got agenda feeding from a list of files based on <code>org-roam-db-query</code> <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  This way I can have TODOs all over the place but I can keep agenda fast by keeping the number of files it considers relatively small.</p>
<p>I keep notes on people. My x-files or rolodex consists of one note per person<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I use <code>org-web-tools</code> to archive pull copies of web pages into notes so that I have references even when the internet breaks. I take a lot of screenshots while doing things and I pull them into my documents with org-download<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When working on long documents I sometimes turn on <code>olivetti-mode</code><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. And I am starting to like org-sticky-header<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I use various things for searching across my org files. When searching for text I use <code>ripgrep</code> <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> , in Spacemacs it&rsquo;s bound to <code>SPC /</code> and you are prompted to choose a top level directory to start your search from. Several years back I used Deft<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> for a while but found that it really didn&rsquo;t suite me well and it simply doesn&rsquo;t perform well<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> for my volume of files. I still have a bunch of files in my deft directory that should probably just move into my roam.</p>
<p>The default display when using <code>org-roam-node-find</code> shows only node names, I find a hierarchy much more useful. I adjusted it to show the node hierarchy using the example shown in the User contributed tricks<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. E.g. File title -&gt; heading 1 -&gt; Heading 2 -&gt; &hellip;</p>

</div>
</div><p>Going mobile with <code>org-mode</code> I use a variety of applications to help. I use Syncthing to syncrhonize files across devices. I only synchronize a subset of my org files to mobile devices. I don&rsquo;t really need the ability to access my whole exocortex on the go.</p>
<p>Orgzly is what I use most often. I really like the home screen widget it provides that allows me to build a query showing recent notes. It makes it easy for managing trips to the store. But the editing experience is lacking, and I am in great wish of an improved capture capabilities. It can&rsquo;t deal with a deep directory structure of files and while that isn&rsquo;t much of an issue for me, it would be a great capability and I do miss it. I had some issues with sync conflicts that lead me to introduce a Tasker automation to synchronize the Orgzly db on screen wake<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. I also make a practice of having one capture file per mobile device. I haven&rsquo;t had many sync conflicts since implementing those things. I re-file my Orgzly captures to my main system way less often than I should. They usually go to my personal journal, someday I hope to have some function to refile to a specific org-roam-dailies-capture template for date at point<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other applications that I use on mobile that deserve mention:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Logseq</dt>
<dd>I really like how daily file are featured. I miss a capture capability. I dislike how the share to target is not stable. It shares to the insertion point. So if the app is open in the background that share might go to some random place I stopped writing. It&rsquo;s convenient at times, other times very inconvenient. I don&rsquo;t love the editing interface. Everything is a headline, so it&rsquo;s a bit ugly when I come to the file in Emacs, but It&rsquo;s what I tend to use if I am writing something longer on mobile, for example that is where I drafted many points for this blog post over the course of a couple months re-visiting it from time to time before I pulled it in to my system for authoring this post.</dd>
<dt>Metanote</dt>
<dd>I don&rsquo;t see other people mention this one. I have found it to be a bit slow but the editing UI is not bad. Also, it has a few capture templates as well as Agenda.</dd>
<dt>Orgro</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s read only, so it&rsquo;s of limited use given my current sync patterns but it&rsquo;s good for that.</dd>

<p>Darly Wakatara has a nice post about how his workflow has evolved  <a href="https://daryl.wakatara.com/emacs-gtd-flow-evolved/">https://daryl.wakatara.com/emacs-gtd-flow-evolved/</a>. I noted that his contact management workflow is similar to mine. Sometime it would be nice to figure out how this could be leveraged for address completion in <code>mu4e</code>. There is <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-contacts.html">org-contacts</a> but it&rsquo;s not clear to me if I can use it with a file per person strategy.&#160;<a href="#fnref:22" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>org-sticky-heading displays in the header-line the Org heading for the node that’s at the top of the window. This way, if the heading for the text at the top of the window is beyond the top of the window, you don’t forget which heading the text belongs to. The display can be customized to show just the heading, the full outline path, or the full outline path in reverse. <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header">https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref:26" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
