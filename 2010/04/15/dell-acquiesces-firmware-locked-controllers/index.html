                <p>I don&#8217;t think I bothered to complain here but I sure sent my fair share of nasty grams. In fact Dell became one of my four letter words after I heard they were <a href="http://lists.us.dell.com/pipermail/linux-poweredge/2010-February/041335.html">firmware locking Gen11 servers to only dell drives</a>. Of course it was a mistake but I loved to unashamedly repeat the famous quote from Howard Shoobe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of benefits for using Dell qualified drives in particular ensuring a positive experience and protecting our data.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I wish they had not tried to do this in the first place, I do want to be sure to give kudos to Dell for listening to reason. Matt Simmons is reporting that <a href="http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2010/04/dell-reverses-position-on-3rd-party-drives/">Dell is reversing its position on 3rd party drives</a>. From the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DELL H-SERIES CONTROLLER BLOCKING OF 3RD PARTY DRIVES</p>

<p>TO BE REMOVED IN Q2FY11</p>

<p>At Dell, we are committed to our customers. We listen to our customers. And, to ensure our customers have a positive experience with our products, we validate and certify all of our PowerEdge servers and components.</p>

<p>Previously, Dell prevented the use of non-Dell hard drives attached to PERC H700 and H800 controllers in our 11th generation of PowerEdge servers as we could not certify these non-Dell drives. However, based on customer feedback, we are now reversing this decision and allowing their use (without support).</p>

<p>Dell will no longer prevent customer use of non-Dell hard drives attached to PERC H700 and H800 controllers on our 11th generation of PowerEdge servers. A Q2FY11 PERC Firmware Update is planned to allow non-Dell hard drives to be used with these controllers.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend choosing Dell drives as we have validated and certified our drives and can support any issues that may arise.</p>

<p>NOTE: There is no change to the current hard drive carrier policy. Hard drive carriers will not be sold separately (3rd party drives are still not supported on Dell Enterprise systems).</p>

<p>Dell, welcome back to my approved vendor list.</p>
