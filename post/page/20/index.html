						<div class="post-summary"><p>I was recently asked how to change screens working directory. It took me a few minutes to realize the benefit of this as I typically have different screen sessions for different purposes. But after thinking about it for a few minutes I have been in situations where what I was doing in a screen session morphed and it would have been nice for new windows to be opened to a different working directory than where I started my session.</p></div>

Handy shell function you can put in your .bashrc. Quickly find out what server a host is running.

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Recently I had to move a website that gets a fair amount of traffic. I prepared for this by lowering the TTL on the domains associated several weeks in advance to 600 seconds. Originally my plan was to toss up a maintenance page on the old server, change the DNS, and figured that within a few hours max the vast majority of DNS servers would have the update being that TTL had been set at 600 seconds for several weeks and prior to that it was set at 48 hours. This was all planned for the middle of the night on a weekend (very slow traffic time). I was in for a rude awakening the next morning.</p></p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>Proper email form (specifically top vs bottom posting) is something that has been on my mind lately. I am trying to share the benefits of trimming and bottom posting with my co-workers. They don&#8217;t seem to be taking kindly to it.</p>

<p>I would say my largest pet peeve when trying to teach good email habits is the &#8220;It takes to long&#8221; comment. In a business setting this sends shooting pains through my bones. Essentially you are saying the customer is not deserving or worth the time to take a few extra seconds when crafting a response.</p>

<p>If your interested in what my thoughts on top vs bottom posting read on.</p></p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p><p>I recently found a vim plug-in for WordPress. <a href="http://friggeri.net/blog/2007/07/13/vimpress">Vimpress</a> allows your to write and edit your blog posts directly from vim. Sure it has its limitations. There does not appear to be support for future data publishing or drafts. But overall its a much better experience to write in vim than the built in editor.</p></p></div>
